                                The major topics those are studied in physics are mechanics, 
                                electricity, magnetism, heat, sound, light and other radiation, 
                                and the structure of atoms. In addition, physics also explains the evolution,

                                Origins of the power used for transportation, 
                                for heat and light in dwelling and working areas, 
                                and for the manufacture of goods of all kinds, 
                                among other applications. The development of 
                                science and civilization is closely linked to 
                                the availability of energy in useful forms. 
                                Modern society consumes vast amounts of energy in all forms: 
                                light, heat, electrical, mechanical, chemical, and nuclear. 
                                The rate at which energy is produced or consumed is called power, 
                                although this term is sometimes used in common speech synonymously 
                                with energy.

                                In addition, the most easily accessed geothermal resources, 
                                natural hot springs and geysers, will not last for more than 
                                a few decades if exploited for energy on a large scale. 
                                Estimates vary widely as to how long fossil fuels, oil, coal, 
                                and natural gas will last. These estimates depend on assumptions 
                                about how much fossil fuel remains in the ground, how fast it will 
                                be used, and how much money and effort will be spent to recover it. 
                                However, most estimates agree that, if present rates of consumption 
                                continue, proven oil and natural gas reserves will run out in this 
                                century, while coal reserves will last more than 200 years. 
                                Once they are used, these energy sources cannot be replaced.

                        <h6>Gravitation based on Newton's Law</h5>
                        <p>
                            <span class="title-ph">Gravity</span> is the mysterious force that
                                makes everything fall down towards the Earth. But after research 
                                it has turned out that all objects have gravity. It’s just that some objects, 
                                like the Earth and the Sun, have a stronger gravity than others. How much 
                                gravity an object has depends its mass. It also depends on how close you are 
                                to the object. The closer you are, the stronger the gravity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Gravity is very important to our everyday lives. 
                            Without Earth’s gravity we would fly right off it. 
                            If you kicked a ball, it would fly off forever. 
                            While it might be fun to try for a few minutes, 
                            we certainly can’t live without gravity. Gravity also is 
                            important on a larger scale. It is the Sun’s gravity that 
                            keeps the Earth in orbit around the Sun. Life on Earth needs 
                            the Sun’s light and warmth to survive. Gravity helps the Earth 
                            to stay at just the right distance from the Sun, so it’s not too 
                            hot or too cold.

                            This is also called the universal law of gravitation or inverse square law. 
                            It states that <span class="law"> “the gravitational force of attraction between two masses 
                                m1 and m2 is directly proportional to the product of masses and inversely

                                called solar system, consists of nine planets. mercury, venus,

                                    Means of Communication are the most necessary part of modern 
                                    lifestyle. In modern age, there are many types of means of 
                                    communications like newspaper, Telephone, Mobile, TV, 
                                    Internet etc. They play very important role in our daily 
                                    life activities. This concept is closely related to the

                                    In telecommunication, a communication system is a collection of individual 
                                    communication networks, transmission systems, relay stations tributary stations 
                                    and Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) usually capable of interconnection and interoperation 
                                    to form an integrated whole.In the transmission section, 
                                    first of all, the source generated information is fed to the input transducer, 
                                    which converts energy of one form to another form, usually in electrical form. 
                                    This electrical signal or base band signal is sent to the transmitter.

                                    <p>
                                        <span class="title-ph">Transmitter:</span> Transmitter modifies the information signal for 
                                        efficient transmission. It modulates the information signal with a high frequency carrier. 
                                        After processing the signal transmitter transmits the signal, through channel to the receiver. <br> 

                                        <span class="title-ph">Channel: </span> Channel, media or path implies the medium through which 
                                        the message travels from the transmitter to the receiver. A channel acts partly as a filter to 
                                        attenuate the signal and distorts its waveform. The signal attenuation increases with the length 
                                        of the channel. There are different types of channels for different communication systems, such as 
                                        wire, coaxial cable, wave-guide, optical fiber or radio link through which transmitter output is sent. <br>

                                        <span class="title-ph">Receiver:</span> Receiver reprocesses the signal received from the channel by undoing 
                                        the signal modifications made at the transmitter and the channel. The receiver output is fed to the output 
                                        transducer, which converts the electrical signal to its original form. By this way, the signal reached to 
                                        its destination, to which the message is communicated.  <br>

                                    Modulation is a technique used for encoding information into a RF channel. 
                                    Typically the process of modulation combines an information signal with a 
                                    carrier signal to create a new composite signal that can be transmitted over
                                    a wireless link. In theory, a message signal can be directly sent into space to a 
                                    receiver by simply powering an antenna with the message signal. However, message 
                                    signals typically don’t have a high enough bandwidth to make efficient direct 
                                    propagation. In order to efficiently transmit data, the lower frequency data 
                                    must be modulated onto a higher frequency wave.

                                    The high frequency wave acts as a carrier that transmits the data through space 
                                    to the receiver where the composite wave is demodulated and the data is recovered.  <br>

                                    The frequency of the carrier is altered at a rate equal to the frequency 
                                    of the audio frequency but the amplitude remains constant.

                                    Frequency modulation is widely used for FM radio broadcasting. 
                                    It is also used in telemetry, radar, seismic prospecting monitoring
                                    new-borns (for seizures via Electroencephalography), two-way radio 
                                    systems, music synthesis, magnetic tape-recording systems and some 
                                    video-transmission systems. In radio transmission, an advantage of 
                                    frequency modulation is that it has a larger signal-to-noise ratio 
                                    and therefore rejects radio frequency interference better than an 
                                    equal power amplitude modulation (AM) signal. For this reason, 
                                    most music is broadcast over FM radio.

                                    before the information is transmitted, it is first mixed to a carrier signal 
                                    so that it can be transmitted over a long distance with low attenuation.

                                    <span class="title-ph">Phase modulation </span> is a form of modulation that encodes information as 
                                    variations in the instantaneous phase of the carrier wave. It is widely 
                                    used for transmitting radio waves and is an integral part of many digital 
                                    transmission coding schemes that underlie a wide range of technologies like 
                                    WiFi, GSM and satellite television. In this type of modulation, the amplitude 
                                    and frequency of the carrier signal remains unchanged after PM. The modulating 
                                    signal is mapped to the carrier signal in the form of variations in the 
                                    instantaneous phase of the carrier signal.Phase modulation is closely 
                                    related to frequency modulation and is often used as intermediate step 
                                    to achieve FM.

                                <p>
                                    A postal, telegraph and telephone service (or PTT) is a government agency responsible for postal mail, 
                                    telegraph and telephone services. Such monopolies existed in many countries, though not in North America 
                                    or Japan. Many PTTs have been partially or completely privatized in recent years. In some of those 
                                    privatizations, the PTT was renamed completely, whereas in others, the name of the privatized corporation 
                                    has been only slightly modified. 
                                    Postal services transport mail and small packages to destinations around the world, and they are mostly 
                                    public corporations. However, there has been increased privatization of postal operators in the past 20 
                                    years, and government restrictions on private postal services have eased. Postal authorities are often 
                                    also involved in telecommunications, logistics, financial services and other business areas.

                                    series of electrical current pulses, usually in the form of Morse code. The basic components 
                                    include a source of direct current, a length of wire or cable, and a current-indicating 
                                    device such as a relay, buzzer or light bulb.

                                    associated with the telephone, a handheld device containing both a speaker or 
                                    transmitter and a receiver. With the arrival of computers and the transmission of 
                                    digital information over telephone systems and the use of radio to transmit telephone 
                                    signals, the distinction between telephony and telecommunication has become difficult.

                                    Sun produces heat of very high intensity that is spread and then received by all surrounding objects. These objects include all the planets 
                                    and other objects around it.

                                    received on the earth surface is slightly below 1400 w/m2.

                                    The main reasons for variation in intensity include: The shape of the earth: The earth has a spherical shape and therefore the sunlight 
                                    is more spread out near the poles 
                                    because it is hitting the earth at an angle, as opposed to hitting the earth straight-on at the equator.

                                    There are <span class="title-ph"> also fewer atmospheres at the equator, allowing more sunlight to reach the earth.</span> Therefore, 
                                    the intensity varies depending on the geographical latitude of the earth’s location.

                                    When the Sun is lower in the sky, a sunbeam strikes the ground at an angle
                                    and so its energy is "spread out" over a larger area
                                    The solar constant represents the mean amount of incoming solar electromagnetic radiation per

                                    The accuracy of the solar constant is questionable due to the following generalizations: 
                                    This radiation is assumed to be incident on a plane perpendicular to the earth's surface. 
                                    It is assumed that the earth is at its mean distance from the sun.

                                    Our seasons also determine how much Sun’s radiation strikes a square meter of ground 
                                    in a given place on the planet's surface at a given time of the year. <span class="title-ph"> The sun’s radiation </span>
