                                                    astronomy, naval and aviation industries, oceanography,
                                                    land surveying, and in cartography (creation of maps).
                                                    Now those are the scientific applications of the concepts
                                                    in trigonometry, but most of the mathematics we study
                                                    would seem (on the surface) to have little real-life
                                                    application. Trigonometry is really relevant in our day to

                                                Solving a triangle is to find the length of its sides and
                                                measures of its angles. There are two methods for solving
                                                a triangle: cosine law and sine law

                                                Origins of the power used for transportation,

                                                and for the manufacture of goods of all kinds, 
                                                among other applications. The development of 
                                                science and civilization is closely linked to 
                                                the availability of energy in useful forms. 
                                                Modern society consumes vast amounts of energy in all forms: 
                                                light, heat, electrical, mechanical, chemical, and nuclear. 
                                                The rate at which energy is produced or consumed is called power, 
                                                although this term is sometimes used in common speech synonymously 
                                                with energy.

                                                In addition, the most easily accessed geothermal resources, 
                                                natural hot springs and geysers, will not last for more than 
                                                a few decades if exploited for energy on a large scale. 
                                                Estimates vary widely as to how long fossil fuels, oil, coal, 
                                                and natural gas will last. These estimates depend on assumptions 
                                                about how much fossil fuel remains in the ground, how fast it will 
                                                be used, and how much money and effort will be spent to recover it. 
                                                However, most estimates agree that, if present rates of consumption 
                                                continue, proven oil and natural gas reserves will run out in this 
                                                century, while coal reserves will last more than 200 years. 
                                                Once they are used, these energy sources cannot be replaced.

                                                 gravity an object has depends its mass. It also depends on how close you are 
                                                 to the object. The closer you are, the stronger the gravity.

                                                Gravity is very important to our everyday lives. 
                                                Without Earth’s gravity we would fly right off it. 
                                                If you kicked a ball, it would fly off forever. 
                                                While it might be fun to try for a few minutes, 
                                                we certainly can’t live without gravity. Gravity also is 
                                                important on a larger scale. It is the Sun’s gravity that 
                                                keeps the Earth in orbit around the Sun. Life on Earth needs 
                                                the Sun’s light and warmth to survive. Gravity helps the Earth 
                                                to stay at just the right distance from the Sun, so it’s not too 
                                                hot or too cold.

                                                    The communication is the way of expressing our thoughts. 
                                                    In other words, communication means sending or receiving 
                                                    message from one end to other. We can express our feelings 
                                                    to others by speaking, writing or silent indications. 
                                                    All living beings communicate to each other in different ways. 
                                                    They have different types of voices and they understand meaning
                                                    of voice of their species. Human has also developed his dialect to 
                                                    communicate with others. We learn different languages to understand 
                                                    meaning of other’s dialects.

                                                    In telecommunication, a communication system is a collection of individual 
                                                    communication networks, transmission systems, relay stations tributary stations 
                                                    and Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) usually capable of interconnection and interoperation 
                                                    to form an integrated whole.In the transmission section, 
                                                    first of all, the source generated information is fed to the input transducer, 
                                                    which converts energy of one form to another form, usually in electrical form. 
                                                    This electrical signal or base band signal is sent to the transmitter.

                                                       efficient transmission. It modulates the information signal with a high frequency carrier. 
                                                       After processing the signal transmitter transmits the signal, through channel to the receiver. <br>

                                                       the message travels from the transmitter to the receiver. A channel acts partly as a filter to 
                                                       attenuate the signal and distorts its waveform. The signal attenuation increases with the length 
                                                       of the channel. There are different types of channels for different communication systems, such as 
                                                       wire, coaxial cable, wave-guide, optical fiber or radio link through which transmitter output is sent. <br>

                                                       transducer, which converts the electrical signal to its original form. By this way, the signal reached to 
                                                       its destination, to which the message is communicated.  <br>

                                                    Modulation is a technique used for encoding information into a RF channel. 
                                                    Typically the process of modulation combines an information signal with a 
                                                    carrier signal to create a new composite signal that can be transmitted over
                                                    a wireless link. In theory, a message signal can be directly sent into space to a 
                                                    receiver by simply powering an antenna with the message signal. However, message 
                                                    signals typically don’t have a high enough bandwidth to make efficient direct 
                                                    propagation. In order to efficiently transmit data, the lower frequency data 
                                                    must be modulated onto a higher frequency wave.

                                                    The high frequency wave acts as a carrier that transmits the data through space 
                                                    to the receiver where the composite wave is demodulated and the data is recovered.  <br>
                                                    There are a few general types of modulation; Frequency Modulation (FM), Phase

                                                    The frequency of the carrier is altered at a rate equal to the frequency 
                                                    of the audio frequency but the amplitude remains constant.

                                                    Frequency modulation is widely used for FM radio broadcasting. 
                                                    It is also used in telemetry, radar, seismic prospecting monitoring
                                                    new-borns (for seizures via Electroencephalography), two-way radio 
                                                    systems, music synthesis, magnetic tape-recording systems and some 
                                                    video-transmission systems. In radio transmission, an advantage of 
                                                    frequency modulation is that it has a larger signal-to-noise ratio 
                                                    and therefore rejects radio frequency interference better than an 
                                                    equal power amplitude modulation (AM) signal. For this reason, 
                                                    most music is broadcast over FM radio.

                                                    In amplitude modulation, the information signal is used to vary the amplitude

                                                    before the information is transmitted, it is first mixed to a carrier signal 
                                                    so that it can be transmitted over a long distance with low attenuation.

                                                    variations in the instantaneous phase of the carrier wave. It is widely

                                                    related to frequency modulation and is often used as intermediate step

                                                    or Japan. Many PTTs have been partially or completely privatized in recent years. In some of those

                                                    received on the earth surface is slightly below 1400 w/m2.

                                                    because it is hitting the earth at an angle, as opposed to hitting the earth straight-on at the equator.

                                                    This radiation is assumed to be incident on a plane perpendicular to the earth's surface. 
                                                    It is assumed that the earth is at its mean distance from the sun.

                                                    reflects light that strikes it. It can be calculated by the ratio of reflected radiation 
                                                    from the surface to the incident radiation upon it.

                                                            trusted individuals should have the powerful privileges to administer database users.

                                                        Security models are useful tools for evaluating and comparing security policies.

                                                            By enforcing policies for time of day, location, and application client and volume of data retrieved,

                                                    <p>The principle addresses the issue who is responsible for the maintenance and management of privileges in the access control model. 
                                                        In centralized administration, a single authority controls all security aspects of the system, while in decentralized system different 
                                                        authorities control different portions of the database. Access control is enforced by a reference monitor which mediates every attempted 
                                                        access by a user to objects in the system. The reference monitor consults an authorization database in order to determine if the user 
                                                        attempting to do an operation is actually authorized to perform that operation. Authorizations in this database are administered 
                                                        and maintained by a security administrator as shown in fig 1. The administrator sets these authorizations on the basis of the 
                                                        security policy. Access control is different from authentication. Authentication is a process of signing on to a computer system by 
                                                        providing an identifier and a password. So, correctly establishing the identity of the user is the responsibility of the authentication 
                                                        service. On the other hand, access control assumes that authentication of the user has been successfully verified prior to enforcement 
                                                        of access control via a reference monitor.</p>

                                                <p>In computer science, an Access Control Matrix or Access Matrix is an abstract, formal security model of protection state in computer 
                                                    systems that characterize the rights of each subject with respect to every object in the system. It was first introduced by
                                                    <span class="title-ph"> Butler W. Lampson in 1971.</span></p>
                                                <p>An access matrix can be envisioned as a rectangular array of cells, with one row per subject and one column per object. The entry in a cell – 
                                                    that is, the entry for a particular subject-object pair, indicates the access mode that the subject is permitted to exercise on the object. 
                                                    Each column is equivalent to an access control list for the object; and each row is equivalent to an access profile for the subject</p>
                                                <p>According to the model, the protection state of a computer system can be abstracted as a set of objects O , that is the set of entities 
                                                    that needs to be protected (e.g. processes, files, memory pages) and a set of subjects S , that consists of all active entities 
                                                    (e.g. users, processes). Further there exists a set of rights R  of the form r(s,o), where r include in R , s include in S and o 
                                                    include in O . A right thereby specifies the kind of access a subject is allowed to process object.</p>

                                                    The view is a widely used method for implementing access control in database applications.  a view mechanism has a double purpose. 
                                                    It is a facility for the user, simplifying and customizing the external model through which the user deals with the database, 
                                                    freeing the user from the complexities of the underlying model.                    
                                                </p>
                                                <p>It is also a security device, hiding structures and data that the user should not see.in the relational and object-relational models, 
                                                    a user’s external model can consist entirely of views. By specifying restrictions in the WHERE line of the SELECT statement used to 
                                                    create views, the view can be made value-dependent. Figure 8.2(A) gives an example of a view created from the Student table by including 
                                                    only data about students whose major is CSC.</p>

                                                    Another important security tool is <span class="title-ph"> the security log </span> , which is a journal that keeps a record of all attempted security violations.  
                                                    key violation can be simply recorded in the log, or it can trigger an immediate message to the system operator or to the DBA. Knowing about the existence of the log can be a deterrent in itself. If the DBA suspects that data is being compromised without triggering security log entries, it is possible to set up an audit trail .

                                                    on the database, even if they are performed by authorized users, such as disgruntled employees.</p>

                                                information properly, the DBMS retrieves the data and decodes it automatically. Encryption should also be used whenever data is communicated to other sites, so that wire tappers will also receive scrambled data.

In the DES scheme, the algorithm itself is public, while the key is private. FIGURE 8.4 gives an overview of 
                                                    the DES process.  the DES algorithm uses a 56-bit key on 64-bit blocks of plaintext, producing 64-bit blocks of ciphertext. When data is encoded, it is split up into 64-bit blocks. Within each block, characters are substituted and rearranged according to the value of the key.  
                                                    the decoding algorithm uses the same key to put back the original characters and to restore them to their original positions in each block. </p>

                                                   it and determines whether it can ful ll the request itself. If not, it  lters the request, perhaps altering it, and requests the service from the server or other resource. It may cache (store a copy of ) the server’s response so that a 
                                                   subsequent request can be full filled from the stored content without using the server again.</p>
                                                <p>the proxy server can be used for several purposes, including to maintain security by hiding the actual IP address of the server, to improve performance by caching, to prevent access to sites that an organization wishes to block from its members, 
                                                    to protect the server from malware, and to protect data by scanning outbound messages for data leaks. </p>

                                                    A successful test is one that finds the errors. It executes the program with explicit intention of finding error, i.e., making the program fail. It is a process of evaluating system with an intention of creating a strong system and mainly focuses on the weak areas of the system or software.

                                                <p>The SSADM method involves the application of a sequence of analysis, documentation and design tasks concerned with the following.</p>
                                                <div class="mt-2">
                                                    <span class="title-ph">Stage 1 – Feasibility study</span>
                                                    <p>In order to determine whether or not a given project is feasible, there must be some form of investigation 
                                                        into the goals and implications of the project. For very small scale projects this may not be necessary 
                                                        at all as the scope of the project is easily understood. In larger projects, the feasibility may be done 
                                                        but in an informal sense, either because there is no time for a formal study or because the project is a 
                                                        “must-have” and will have to be done one way or the other. A data flow Diagram is used to describe how the 
                                                        current system works and to visualize the known problems.</p>
                                                    <p>When a feasibility study is carried out, there are four main areas of consideration:</p>  
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Technical – is the project technically possible?</li>
                                                        <li>Financial – can the business afford to carry out the project?</li>
                                                        <li>Organizational – will the new system be compatible with existing practices?</li>
                                                        <li>Ethical – is the impact of the new system socially acceptable?</li>
                                                    </ul>  
                                                    <p>To answer these questions, the feasibility study is effectively a condensed version of a comprehensive systems analysis and design. 
                                                        The requirements and usages are analyzed to some extent, some business options are drawn up and even some details of the technical 
                                                        implementation. The product of this stage is a formal feasibility study document. SSADM specifies the sections that the study should 
                                                        contain including any preliminary models that have been constructed and also details of rejected options and the reasons for their 
                                                        rejection.</p>

                                                    <p>The developers of SSADM understood that in almost all cases there is some form of current system even if it is entirely composed of people and paper. 
                                                        Through a combination of interviewing employees, circulating questionnaires, observations and existing documentation, the analyst comes to full understanding 
                                                        of the system as it is at the start of the project. This serves many purposes (Like examples?).</p>

                                                    <p>Having investigated the current system, the analyst must decide on the overall design of the new system. To do this, he or she, using the outputs of the previous stage, 
                                                        develops a set of business system options. These are different ways in which the new system could be produced varying from doing nothing to throwing out the old system 
                                                        entirely and building an entirely new one. The analyst may hold a brainstorming session so that as many and various ideas as possible are generated.</p>
                                                        <p>The ideas are then collected to options which are presented to the user. The options consider the following:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>the degree of automation</li>
                                                        <li>the boundary between the system and the users</li>
                                                        <li>the distribution of the system, for example, is it centralized to one office or spread out across several?</li>
                                                        <li>cost/benefit</li>
                                                        <li>impact of the new system</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>Where necessary, the option will be documented with a logical data structure and a level 1 data-flow diagram.</p>   
                                                    <p>The users and analyst together choose a single business option. This may be one of the ones already defined or 
                                                        may be a synthesis of different aspects of the existing options. The output of this stage is the single selected 
                                                        business option together with all the outputs of the feasibility stage.</p>

                                                    <p>This is probably the most complex stage in SSADM. Using the requirements developed in stage 1 and working within 
                                                        the framework of the selected business option, the analyst must develop a full logical specification of what the 
                                                        new system must do. The specification must be free from error, ambiguity and inconsistency. 
                                                        By logical, we mean that the specification does not say how the system will be implemented but 
                                                        rather describes what the system will do.</p>
                                                    <p>To produce the logical specification, the analyst builds the required logical models for both the data-flow diagrams 
                                                        (DFDs) and the Logical Data Model (LDM), consisting of the Logical Data Structure (referred to in other methods as 
                                                        entity relationship diagrams) and full descriptions of the data and its relationships. 
                                                        These are used to produce function definitions of every function which the users will 
                                                        require of the system, Entity Life-Histories (ELHs) which describe all events through the life of an entity, 
                                                        and Effect Correspondence Diagrams (ECDs) which describe how each event interacts with all relevant entities. 
                                                        These are continually matched against the requirements and where necessary, the requirements are added to and completed.</p> 
                                                    <p>The product of this stage is a complete requirements specification document which is made up of:</p>

                                                        for the human computer interface. The logical design specifies the main methods of interaction in terms of menu structures and command structures.</p>
                                                    <p>One area of activity is the definition of the user dialogues. These are the main interfaces with which the users will interact with the system. Other activities

                                                    <p>The physical design relates to the actual input and output processes of the system. 
                                                        This is explained in terms of how data is input into a system, how it is verified/authenticated, 
                                                        how it is processed, and how it is displayed. In physical design, the following requirements about 
                                                        the system are decided.</p>

                                                    <p>Put another way, the physical portion of system design can generally be broken down into three subtasks:</p>  
                                                    <ol type="1">
                                                        <li>User Interface Design</li>
                                                        <li>Data Design</li>
                                                        <li>Process Design</li>
                                                    </ol>
                                                    <p>User Interface Design is concerned with how users add information to the system and with how the system 
                                                        presents information back to them. Data Design is concerned with how the data is represented and stored 
                                                        within the system. Finally, Process Design is concerned with how data moves through the system, 
                                                        and with how and where it is validated, secured and/or transformed as it flows into, through and out 
                                                        of the system. At the end of the system design phase, documentation describing the three sub-tasks is 
                                                        produced and made available for use in the next phase.</p>
                                                    <p>Physical design, in this context, does not refer to the tangible physical design of an information system. 
                                                        To use an analogy, a personal computer's physical design involves input via a keyboard, processing within 
                                                        the CPU, and output via a monitor, printer, etc. It would not concern the actual layout of the tangible 
                                                        hardware, which for a PC would be a monitor, CPU, motherboard, hard drive, modems, video/graphics cards, 
                                                        USB slots, etc. It involves a detailed design of a user and a product database structure processor and a 
                                                        control processor. The H/S personal specification is developed for the proposed system.</p>
                                                    <p>This is the final stage where all the logical specifications of the system are converted to descriptions 
                                                        of the system in terms of real hardware and software. This is a very technical stage and a simple overview 
                                                        is presented here.</p>   
                                                    <p>The logical data structure is converted into a physical architecture in terms of database structures. 
                                                        The exact structure of the functions and how they are implemented is specified. The physical data structure 
                                                        is optimized where necessary to meet size and performance requirements.</p>  
                                                    <p>The product is a complete Physical Design which could tell software engineers how to build the system in 
                                                        specific details of hardware and software and to the appropriate standards.</p>

                                            <p>In the object-oriented approach, the focus is on capturing the structure and behavior of information systems into small 
                                                modules that combines both data and process. The main aim of Object Oriented Design (OOD) is to improve the quality and 
                                                productivity of system analysis and design by making it more usable.</p>
                                            <p>In analysis phase, OO models are used to fill the gap between problem and solution. It performs well in situation where systems 
                                                are undergoing continuous design, adaption, and maintenance. It identifies the objects in problem domain, classifying them in 
                                                terms of data and behavior.</p>

                                                    <p>Encapsulation is a process of information hiding. It is simply the combination of process and data into a single entity. Data of an object is hidden from the rest of the system and available only through the services of the class. 
                                                        It allows improvement or modification of methods used by objects without affecting other parts of a system.</p>

                                                        Its task is to build the application quickly and incrementally implement the user requirements design through tools such as visual basic, power builder, etc.

                                                    We know that a problem or in this case, the project’s scope well stated is half-solved. No matter how you do it,
                                                    it pays to be clear about your objectives, scope, budget, and methodology right out of the gate. One way to do
                                                    this is through a meeting or forum, depending on who your project is ultimately going to serve.
                                                    For example, you’re tasked to build a website for a particular company. You should then confer with the
                                                    company’s decision-makers to know what they want their website to include, including how they would like
                                                    the information to be presented, the overall tone or theme of the web pages, among others. Or if you’d like to
                                                    build an app specifically for people who are differently abled, you might want to meet with a focus group
                                                    comprised of special education teachers, psychologists, and other learning specialists.

                                                <p>Once you’ve clearly defined the scope of the project, identifying the talents needed to execute your vision
                                                    becomes easier. Carefully select the individuals who will make up your team, and delegate tasks and activities
                                                    to people best suited for each. Proper task delegation can come off as a show of confidence in your team
                                                    members’ inherent abilities, which then boosts morale and becomes instrumental in bringing about the best

                                                    Having a clear idea of what to expect for a final product allows you to create short-term goals. Outline goals
                                                    that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely. After delegating the appropriate tasks to your team
                                                    members, have each of them list down subtasks that will serve as milestones towards their final goal, and then,
                                                    let them set their own deadlines for each milestone.
                                                    These deadlines, of course, have to coincide with the project’s overall time targets. Going back to the example

                                                    Data storage is getting more and more affordable and more easily accessible. However, with easier accessibility,
                                                    security issues arise. While most cloud-based data management solutions keep a close eye on data security,
                                                    which is one of their major selling points, things can sometimes get out of hand. To be doubly sure, it’s
                                                    imperative that you manage file permissions, document ownerships, and monitor data versions on a consistent

                                                    Being aware of project, team and individual deadlines is a must to continually propel a project forward. Sending
                                                    out regular status updates through face-to-face/virtual meetings or via an enterprise social tool – like
                                                    Comindware Team Network, which is the collaboration framework on which Comindware Project is founded
                                                    – ensures everyone has a big-picture view of the project’s progress and how each individual’s contribution fits
                                                    into the whole. A tracker is a convenient way to keep abreast of important dates, like the target versus
                                                    completion date of each short-term goal.
                                                    Setting up alerts for items that are nearing their scheduled dates of completion, as well as those that have fallen
                                                    behind schedule, is also recommended.

                                                    When it comes to motivating teams, awarding members for good performance takes the cake over punishing
                                                    those that underperform. As each team member achieves a milestone, recognize their accomplishments through
                                                    team R&R (rewards and recognition) sessions, or even one-onone, as knowing their contributions are valued
                                                    by the company makes people more inclined to perform.
                                                    Also, it’s worth noting that some individuals may like the attention of being acknowledged publicly, and some
                                                    prefer to have their accomplishments recognized by their leaders privately.

                                                    phases of project management: <span class="title-ph">planning,</span> <span class="title-ph">build-up,</span> <span class="title-ph">implementation,</span> and <span class="title-ph">closeout.</span> Even though the phases
                                                    have distinct qualities, they overlap.
                                                    For example, you’ll typically begin planning with a ballpark budget figure and an estimated completion date.
                                                    Once you’re in the build-up and implementation phases, you’ll define and begin to execute the details of theproject plan. That will give you new information, so you’ll revise your budget and end date in other words, do
                                                    more planning according to your clearer understanding of the big picture.
                                                    Here’s an overview of each phase and the activities involved.

                                                    When people think of project planning, their minds tend to jump immediately to scheduling but you won’t even
                                                    get to that part until the build-up phase. Planning is really about defining fundamentals: what problem needs
                                                    solving, who will be involved, and what will be done.

                                                    Before you begin, take time to pinpoint what issue the project is actually supposed to fi x. It’s not always
                                                    obvious. Say the CIO at your company has asked you, an IT manager, to develop a new database and data entry
                                                    system. You may be eager to jump right into the project to tackle problems you have struggled with firsthand.
                                                    But will that solve the company’s problem? To increase the project’s chances of success, you must look beyond
                                                    the symptoms you have observed “We can’t get the data out fast enough” and “I have to sift through four
                                                    different reports just to compile an update on my clients’ recent activity” to find the underlying issues the
                                                    organization is trying to address. Before designing the database, you should ask what type of data is required,
                                                    what will be done with it, how soon a fix is needed, and so on. If you don’t, you’ll run the risk of wasting time
                                                    and money by creating a solution that is too simplistic, too complicated, or too late or one that doesn’t do what
                                                    users need it to do.

                                                <p>
                                                    The real problem will become even clearer once you figure out who all your stakeholders are that is, which
                                                    functions or people might be affected by the project’s activities or outcomes, who will contribute resources
                                                    (people, space, time, tools, and money), and who will use and benefit from the project’s output. They will work
                                                    with you to spell out exactly what success on the project means. Have them sign off on what they expect at the
                                                    end of the project and what they are willing to contribute to it. And if the stakeholders change midstream, be
                                                    prepared not only to respond to the new players but also to include all the others in any decision to redirect the
                                                    project.

                                                    One of your most challenging planning tasks is to meld stakeholders’ various expectations into a coherent and
                                                    manageable set of goals. The project’s success will be measured by how well you meet those goals. The more
                                                    explicitly you state them at the outset, the less disagreement you will face later about whether you have met
                                                    expectations.
                                                    In the planning phase, however, much is still in flux, so you’ll revise your objectives later on, as you gather
                                                    information about what you need to achieve.

                                                    Many projects fail either because they bite off more than they can chew and thus grossly underestimate time
                                                    and money or because a significant part of the work has been overlooked
                                                    (ignored). One tool that can help you avoid these problems is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), which
                                                    aids in the process of determining scope and tasks and developing estimates. The underlying concept is to
                                                    subdivide complex activities into their most manageable units. To create a WBS: 
                                                </p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>Ask, “What will have to be done in order to accomplish X?”</li>
                                                    <li>Continue to ask this question until your answer is broken down into tasks that cannot be subdivided further. </li>
                                                    <li>Estimate how long it will take to complete these tasks and how much they will cost in terms of dollars and person-hours</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p>
                                                    As a result of your thoughtful planning, you’ll be able to rough out an estimate of how many people with what
                                                    skills you’ll need for the project. You’ll also have a good idea of how long the project will take.
                                                    <span class="title-ph">Prepare for trade-offs</span>
                                                    Time, cost, and quality are the three related variables that typically dictate what you can achieve.
                                                    <span class="title-ph">Quality = Time + Cost</span>
                                                    Change any of these variables, and you change your outcome. Of course, such alterations often occur in the
                                                    middle of a project. If your time frame for developing a new database management system is suddenly cut in
                                                    half, for instance, you will need to either employ twice the number of people or be satisfied with a system that
                                                    isn’t as robust as originally planned. Don’t let bells and whistles get in the way of mission-critical activities.
                                                    The key is to establish a level of quality that meets your stakeholders’ needs.
                                                    Knowing from the start which variable is most important to each stakeholder will help you make the right
                                                    changes along the way. It’s your responsibility to keep everyone informed of any tweaks and tell them what the
                                                    consequences will be in terms of time, cost, and quality.

                                                    In the build-up phase, you bring your team together. Time estimates become schedules. Cost estimates become
                                                    budgets. You gather your resources. You get commitments, and you make them.

                                                    Your first task in this phase is to assess the skills needed for the project so you can get the right people on board.
                                                    This assessment flows directly from the Work Breakdown Structure you did during the planning phase, in which
                                                    you developed your best estimate of the necessary tasks and activities. You may need to bring in people either
                                                    temporary workers or employees from other parts of the organization who have certain skills. Don’t forget to
                                                    budget time and money for training to cover any gaps you can’t fill with people who are already up to speed.

                                                    If you’ve built your own team, you’ve probably already decided who will do what. Or, if you’ve inherited a
                                                    team but worked with the members before, you can still make the assignments yourself. But if a new, unfamiliar
                                                    group is assigned to you, list the people on the team, list the skills required, and talk to each team member about
                                                    her own skill set before you match people to tasks. This approach starts the process of team communication and
                                                    cohesion.

                                                    It would be nice if you could tally up the to-dos and say, “With the resources we have, we will need this much
                                                    time” and then get exactly what you’ve asked for. But the reality is, most projects come with fixed beginning
                                                    and end dates, regardless of available resources.
                                                    To create a realistic schedule within those constraints, work backward from any drop-dead deadlines you know
                                                    about that is, dates that cannot be changed to see when your deliverables must be ready. For instance, if an
                                                    annual report is due for a shareholder’s meeting and you know it takes the printer two weeks, then all the final

                                                    over the project’s plan and objectives with the group in as much detail as possible, and review the proposed

                                                <p>
                                                    The first question to ask when developing a budget is, “What will it take to actually do the work?” To determine
                                                    your costs, break down the project into the following categories: personnel, travel, training, supplies, space,
                                                    research, capital expenditures, and overhead.
                                                    After you’ve entered the figures from these standard categories into the budget, ask a trusted adviser what you
                                                    forgot. Did you overlook insurance? Licensing fees? Costs for legal or accounting support?
                                                    A budget, no matter how carefully planned, is just your best guess. Expect actual numbers to deviate from
                                                    original estimates, and stay as flexible as possible within your limitations of time, quality demands, and total

                                                    actually gets done, but it can also be the most frustrating. The details can be tedious and, at times, overwhelming.

                                                    Respond quickly to changes in data or information as they come in, and look for early signs of problems so you
                                                    can initiate corrective action. Otherwise, all you are doing is monitoring, not exercising control. Make it clear

                                                    When you’re immersed in project details, it’s easy to be diverted from critical activities to side paths that waste
                                                    time. You and your team can stay focused by meeting once a week and periodically asking yourselves what’s
                                                    essential to the project’s success.
                                                    Set clear agendas for your meetings. Try structuring them around production numbers, revenue goals, or
                                                    whatever other metrics you’ve chosen to gauge performance. Many of your agenda items will naturally stem
                                                    from targets the project has missed, met, or exceeded: For instance, you may need to discuss as a group whether
                                                    to incorporate more travel into the project because you’ve noticed a decline in productivity at a satellite office.
                                                    Or you might ask the product designers on your team to continue gathering among themselves on a biweekly
                                                    basis because they’ve doubled their creative output since they’ve begun doing so. Keep the momentums going
                                                    by following up each week on any to-dos and connecting them with the metrics for overall performance. Also,
                                                    celebrate small successes along the way that will rekindle the team’s enthusiasm as you make progress toward

                                                    Some problems have such far-reaching consequences that they can threaten the success of the entire project.
                                                    The most common are: time slippage, scope creep, quality issues, and people problems. 
                                                    Pay attention to small signs of emerging problems, such as a team member’s increased tension and irritability,
                                                    loss of enthusiasm, or inability to make decisions. When you see signs like these, get to the heart of the problem
                                                    quickly and deal with it. Don’t let it grow from a small irritant into a disaster.

                                                    Before closing out your project, your team needs to meet its goals (or determine, along with key stakeholders,
                                                    that those goals no longer apply). Compare your progress with the scope everyone agreed on at the beginning.
                                                    That will tell you how well the project has performed—and if there’s still work to do. When you discuss your
                                                    findings with your stakeholders, make sure you reach consensus with them on how “finished” the project is.
                                                    Keep your scope front and center so everyone uses the same yardstick to measure success.

                                                    The steps you take to wrap things up will depend on whether your team assumes ownership of its own

                                                    some rough spots along the way the project takes longer than expected, the result is less than hoped for, or the

                                                “Close Project or Phase is the process of finalizing all activities for the project, phase, or contract. The key
                                                benefits of this process are the project or phase information is archived, the planned work is completed, and
                                                organizational team resources are released to pursue new endeavors.
                                                This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project.
                                                Closing a project is not like switching a computer off. There is still a lot to be done, and a lot that can go wrong.
                                                The Close Project or Phase process is another one where the Project Manager takes centre stage and will be
                                                checking that that all project work is completed and that the project has met its objectives, including work and
                                                objectives that were added along the way as the result of approved change requests.
                                                Just a reminder here that the type of “phase” mentioned here is a mini-project inside the main project.
                                                The activities necessary for the administrative closure of the project or phase include:

                                                <li>Actions and activities necessary to satisfy completion or exit criteria for the phase or project such as: 
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Making certain that all documents and deliverables are up-to-date and that all issues are resolved; </li>
                                                        <li>
                                                            Confirming the delivery and formal acceptance of deliverables by the customer; o
                                                            Ensuring that all costs are charged to the project; o Closing project accounts; o Reassigning
                                                            personnel. Depending upon the organization type (we will be covering organization types later in
                                                            the course) the project staff will be assigned to another project, or they will return to their usual jobs,
                                                            or their contracts will be finalized and they will leave the organization to take up the next contract.
                                                            o Dealing with excess project material. This can mean dealing with the materials and equipment that
                                                            is lying around after the project has finished. For example, after completing a building there will be
                                                            piles of bricks, sands, roof tiles, off cuts of wood, bags of cement, and so on. All this needs to be
                                                            dealt with. Some can be returned to stock, machines will be returned to the store, or returned to the
                                                            hire company, and material that can’t be reused or recycled but be cleared away. o Reallocating
                                                            project facilities, equipment, and other resources; and o Elaborating the final project reports as
                                                            required by organizational policies. We are examining the activities necessary for administrative
                                                            closure of a project phase. These would also include:

                                                            be recording lessons learned as they are learned, rather than waiting until the end, because you will
                                                            have forgotten them. o Archive project information for future use by the organization. </li>

                                                    Actions and activities necessary to transfer the project’s products, services, or results to the next phase
                                                    or to production and/or operations. The whole point of the project is to create a unique product, service,
                                                    or result. But that means you have to hand them over. In most projects, deliverable will be completed
                                                    and handed over throughout the project, rather than doing it all in one hit. The one hit problem is you
                                                    may discover a serious, previously undetected fault in the dying stages of the project. This is a very bad
                                                    time to discover a serious fault. 
                                                </li>
                                                <li>

                                                    and sending them to the appropriate organizational unit. This will probably overlap with recording
                                                    lessons learned. Remember to be as specific and focused as possible. Use metrics where possible,
                                                    because if you can’t measure it, you can’t tell if it has been improved.

                                                <li><span class="title-ph">Measuring stakeholder satisfaction.</span> The Close Project or Phase process also establishes the procedures to investigate and document the
                                                    reasons for actions taken if a project is terminated before completion. In order to successfully achieve
                                                    this, the project manager needs to engage all the proper stakeholders in the process. My preferred way
                                                    to do this is by questionnaire and survey.
                                                    And “no”, questionnaire and survey don’t mean the same thing. The questionnaire is the question and
                                                    answer sheet, and a survey is a tool for analyzing the results. </li>

                                                        analyzes the interrelationships between different project variables that contributed to the project
                                                        outcomes to improve performance on future projects. Sometimes this can be combined with
                                                        Sensitivity Analysis techniques, which involves re-examining the interrelationships, which keeping

                                                        organization and to implement adjustments for future projects. This is important because there is a

                                                        be used to improve the metrics of the organization by comparing what was initially planned against

                                                    close your project and then report its overall level of success to your sponsor. Project Closure involves handing

                                                    After the project has been closed, a Post Implementation Review is completed to determine the projects
                                                    success and identify the lessons learned.
                                                    The first step taken when closing a project is to create a Project Closure Report. It is extremely important that
                                                    you list every activity required to close the project within this Project Closure report, to ensure that project
                                                    closure is completed smoothly and efficiently. Once the report has been approved by your sponsor, the closure
                                                    activities stated in the report are actioned.

                                                    system.[8] Its implementation began in December 1989. and developed by Python Software
                                                    Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows
                                                    programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
                                                    Python is a high-level, interpreted and general-purpose dynamic programming language that
                                                    focuses on code readability. The syntax in Python helps the programmers to do coding in fewer
                                                    steps as compared to Java or C++. Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, objectoriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during
                                                    1985 – 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public
                                                    License (GPL). Python is named after a TV Show called ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’ and

                                                        to code it in a couple of hours or days. As compared to other object-oriented programming
                                                        languages like Java, C, C++, and C#, Python is one of the easiest to learn.</li>
                                                    <li><span class="title-ph">Expressive</span> First, let’s learn about expressiveness. Suppose we have two languages A and B, and all
                                                        programs that can be made in A can be made in B using local transformations. However, there
                                                        are some programs that can be made in B, but not in A, using local transformations. Then, B is
                                                        said to be more expressive than A. Python provides us with a myriad of constructs that help us
                                                        focus on the solution rather than on the syntax. This is one of the outstanding python features
                                                        that tell you why you should learn Python.</li>

                                                        Secondly, it is open-source. This means that its source code is available to the public. You can
                                                        download it, change it, use it, and distribute it. This is called FLOSS(Free/Libre and Open
                                                        Source Software). As the Python community, we’re all headed toward one goal- an everbettering Python.</li>
                                                    <li><span class="title-ph"> High-Level language</span> As we discussed in point 2b, it is a high-level language. This means that as programmers, we
                                                        don’t need to remember the system architecture. Nor do we need to manage the memory. This
                                                        makes it more programmer-friendly and is one of the key python features.</li> 
                                                    <li><span class="title-ph">Portable</span> Let’s assume you’ve written a Python code for your Windows machine. Now, if you want to
                                                        run it on a Mac, you don’t need to make changes to it for the same. In other words, you can take one code and run it on any machine, there is no need to write different code for different
                                                        machines. This makes Python a portable language. However, you must avoid any systemdependent features in this case.</li> 
                                                    <li><span class="title-ph">Interpreted</span> If you’re familiar with any languages like C++ or Java, you must first compile it, and then run
                                                        it. But in Python, there is no need to compile it. Internally, its source code is converted into an
                                                        immediate form called bytecode. So, all you need to do is to run your Python code without
                                                        worrying about linking to libraries, and a few other things.By interpreted, we mean the source
                                                        code is executed line by line, and not all at once. Because of this, it is easier to debug your
                                                        code. Also, interpreting makes it just slightly slower than Java, but that does not matter
                                                        compared to the benefits it has to offer.</li>
                                                    <li><span class="title-ph">Object-Oriented approach</span> A programming language that can model the real world is said to be object-oriented. It focuses
                                                        on objects and combines data and functions. Contrarily, a procedure-oriented language revolves
                                                        around functions, which are code that can be reused. Python supports both procedureoriented and object-oriented programming which is one of the key python features. It also
                                                        supports multiple inheritances, unlike Java. A class is a blueprint for such an object. It is an
                                                        abstract data type and holds no values.</li>

                                                        Python an extensible language, meaning that it can be extended to other languages.</li>

                                                        also possible to put our Python code in a source code in a different language like C++. This
                                                        allows us to integrate scripting capabilities into our program of the other language.</li>

                                                        code for every single thing. There are libraries for regular expressions, documentationgeneration, unit-testing, web browsers, threading, databases, CGI, email, image manipulation,
                                                        and a lot of other functionality.</li>

                                                        with a GUI. Python offers various libraries for making Graphical user interface for your
                                                        applications. For this, you can use Tkinter, wxPython or JPython. These toolkits allow you for

                                                        editor helps the programmer for writing scripts, modifying code or text etc.
                                                        But with IDE a programmer can perform several other functions as well like running and
                                                        executing the code, controlling the version, debug, interpreting, compiling, auto-complete
                                                        feature, auto linting function, pre-defined functions and in build terminal etc.
                                                        IDE can be considered as a development environment where a programmer can write the script,
                                                        compile and debug the completing process.
                                                        IDE also has an integrated file management system and deployment tool. IDE provides support
                                                        to SVN, CVS, FTP, SFTP, framework etc. Basically, a Text editor is a simple editor to edit the
                                                        source code and it does not possess any integrated tools or packages.
                                                        One advantage of Text editor is that it allows modifying all types of files rather than specifying
                                                        any particular language or types. Both play an important role in their respective situations when

                                                    <p> There are a lot of benefits of using Python IDE like developing a better quality code, debugging

                                                        An ideal IDE selection is purely based on the developer requirement like if a developer has to

                                                        required or features like autocomplete and class browsers are required</p>

                                                    <p> What do Python programmers need to make their life easier? The answer is frameworks.
                                                        By automating the implementation of redundant tasks, frameworks cut development
                                                        time and enable developers to focus greatly on application logic rather than routine
                                                        elements.
                                                        Because it is one of the leading programming languages, there is no scarcity of
                                                        frameworks for Python. Different frameworks have their own set of advantages and
                                                        issues. Hence, the selection needs to be made on the basis of project requirements and
                                                        developer preference.
                                                        There are primarily three types of Python frameworks, namely full-stack, microframework, and asynchronous. Before moving onto discussing the best Python

                                                    flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced.
                                                    Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.Where in other programming
                                                    languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very
                                                    important.</p>

                                                    you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.</p>

                                                <p> A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of
                                                    values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parenthesis.</p>
                                                <p> The main difference between lists and tuples is- Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their
                                                    elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot
                                                    be updated. Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists. For example</p>

                                                <p> Python's dictionaries are kind of hash-table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes
                                                    found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type,
                                                    but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python
                                                    object.
                                                    A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries
                                                    are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.
                                                    Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed using
                                                    square braces ([]). For example</p>

                                                <p> There are no well-defined standards for writing algorithms. Rather, it is problem and resource
                                                    dependent. Algorithms are never written to support a particular programming code.
                                                    As we know that all programming languages share basic code constructs like loops (do, for,
                                                    while), flow-control (if-else), etc. These common constructs can be used to write an algorithm.
                                                    We write algorithms in a step-by-step manner, but it is not always the case. Algorithm writing

                                                    the problem domain, for which we are designing a solution.</p>

                                                    We design an algorithm to get a solution of a given problem. A problem can be solved in more

                                                    of For statement is the implementation of definite iteration over the range of values.
                                                    There would be an if-else and an if function used to implement conditions in an Algorithm.
                                                    Below is an example of such a function.</p>

                                            <p> Decision-making is the anticipation of conditions occurring during the execution of a program
                                                and specified actions taken according to the conditions.
                                                Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions, which produce TRUE or FALSE as the
                                                outcome. You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if the
                                                outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.
                                                Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the
                                                programming languages</p>

                                                Programming languages provide various control structures that allow more complicated execution
                                                paths.
                                                A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.

                                                    In Python, all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a

                                                <p> A loop becomes infinite loop if a condition never becomes FALSE. You must be cautious when
                                                    using while loops because of the possibility that this condition never resolves to a FALSE value.
                                                    This results in a loop that never ends. Such a loop is called an infinite loop.
                                                    An infinite loop might be useful in client/server programming where the server needs to run
                                                    continuously so that client programs can communicate with it as and when required.</p>

                                                    SQL stands for “Structured Query Language”. It is a query language used for accessing and modifying
                                                    information in the database.
                                                    IBM first developed SQL in 1970s. Also it is an ANSI/ISO standard. It has become a Standard Universal
                                                    Language used by most of the relational database management systems (RDBMS). Some of the RDBMS systems
                                                    are: Oracle, Microsoft SQL server, Sybase etc.

                                                            Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of

                                                            Constraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column, and table level
                                                            constraints apply to the whole table.

                                                            By default, a column can hold NULL values. The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to NOT accept NULL
                                                            values.
                                                            This enforces a field to always contain a value, which means that you cannot insert a new record, or update a
                                                            record without adding a value to this field.
                                                            The following SQL ensures that the "ID", "LastName", and "FirstName" columns will NOT accept NULL values:

                                                            The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different. Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY

                                                            A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint. However, you can have many UNIQUE

                                                            The "PersonID" column in the "Persons" table is the PRIMARY KEY in the "Persons" table.
                                                            The "PersonID" column in the "Orders" table is a FOREIGN KEY in the "Orders" table.
                                                            The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
                                                            The FOREIGN KEY constraint also prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column,
                                                            because it has to be one of the values contained in the table it points to.

                                                            to simplify processing logic.

                                                            An index is a data structure consisting of addresses (db-keys) and values from one or more data elements of a
                                                            given entity. Indexes enhance processing performance by providing alternate access keys to entities.

                                                            While indexes minimize the number of I/Os required to retrieve data from the database, they require extra storage
                                                            space and add overhead for maintenance. The addition of an index actually increases the I/Os and processing

                                                        A self-join is a join in which a table is joined with itself (which is also called Unary relationships), especially
                                                        when the table has a FOREIGN KEY which references its own PRIMARY KEY. To join a table itself means that
                                                        each row of the table is combined with itself and with every other row of the table.
                                                        The self-join can be viewed as a join of two copies of the same table. The table is not actually copied, but SQL
                                                        performs the command as though it were.
                                                        The syntax of the command for joining a table to itself is almost same as that for joining two different tables. To
                                                        distinguish the column names from one another, aliases for the actual the table name are used, since both the
                                                        tables have the same name. Table name aliases are defined in the FROM clause of the SELECT statement.

                                                        A Subquery or Inner query or a Nested query is a query within another SQL query and embedded within the
                                                        WHERE clause.
                                                        A subquery is used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data to
                                                        be retrieved.
                                                        Subqueries can be used with the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements along with the operators
                                                        like =, <, >, >=, <=, IN, BETWEEN, etc.
                                                        There are a few rules that subqueries must follow:

                                                        <li>A subquery can have only one column in the SELECT clause, unless multiple columns are in the main

                                                            An ORDER BY command cannot be used in a subquery, although the main query can use an ORDER

                                                    command line.

                                                    mentioned, depending on how the inputs are defined, changed values to inputs can be propagated back to the

                                                <p>
                                                    Here is an example of a stored procedure that takes a parameter, executes a query and return a result. Specifically,
                                                    the stored procedure accepts the BusinessEntityID as a parameter and uses this to match the primary key of the
                                                    HumanResources.Employee table to return the requested employee. 
                                                </p>
                                                <img src="img_SFDLT_5/database_develop-26.png" alt="">
                                                <p>
                                                    Though this example returns a single row, due to the fact we are matching to the primary key, stored procedures
                                                    can also be used to return multiple rows, or a single value.
                                                    Stored procedures can be called from within SQL server. To call this stored procedure from the SQL server
                                                    command line or from another stored procedure you would use the following:
                                                    exec HumanResources.uspFindEmployee 3
                                                    Stored procedures can also be called from within a programming language. Each language, such as PHP or C#,
                                                    has its specific methods for doing so.

                                                        just used to speed up searches/queries. </li>  
                                                    <li>The INSERT and UPDATE statements take more time on tables having indexes, whereas the SELECT
                                                        statements become fast on those tables. The reason is that while doing insert or update, a database needs
                                                        to insert or update the index values as well. </li>  
                                                    <li>Note: Updating a table with indexes takes more time than updating a table without (because the indexes
                                                        also need an update). So, only create indexes on columns that will be frequently searched against. </li>

                                                <p>You can create a unique index on a table. A unique index means that two rows cannot have the same index value.
                                                Here is the syntax to create an Index on a table.
                                                Creating an index involves the CREATE INDEX statement, which allows you to name the index, to specify the
                                                table and which column or columns to index, and to indicate whether the index is in an ascending or descending
                                                order. </p>
                                                <code>CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2,...); </code>
                                                <p>You can use one or more columns to create an index.
                                                   For example, we can create an index on persons table using firstname. </p>
                                                <p>CREATE UNIQUE INDEX fname_INDEX ON persons (firstname) </p>   
                                                <p>
                                                    You can create a simple index on a table. Just omit the UNIQUE keyword from the query to create a simple index.
                                                    A Simple index allows duplicate values in a table.
                                                    If you want to index the values in a column in a descending order, you can add the reserved word DESC after the
                                                    column name. 
                                                </p>
                                                <code>CREATE UNIQUE INDEX fname_INDEX ON persons (firstname DESC) </code>

                                            <p>A file format is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. It specifies how bits are
                                                used to encode information in a digital storage medium. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                There are two different ways of storing data in a file – as text or binary data. Text-based file formats, such as
                                                XML and HTML, store data as plain text, which means the file content can be viewed in a text editor. Binary
                                                files, on the other hand, can only be opened with a program that recognizes the specific file format. While some
                                                binary files can be opened in a text editor, most of the data will appear corrupted and meaningless. 
                                            </p>    
                                            <p>DB files can be created using database software like Microsoft Access, Filemaker Pro and others. DB files can
                                                be exported or imported in different formats like .CSV format. </p>

                                                A data file could be any file, but for the purpose of this list, we've listed the most common data files that relate to
                                                data used for a database, importing, and exporting.

                                                Short for comma-separated values, CSV is tabular data that has been saved as plaintext data separated by commas.
                                                For example, if you had a table similar to the example below that data would be converted to the CSV data shown

                                                        Because the CSV is plain-text it makes the data easy to import into any spreadsheet program or database

                                            <p> Microsoft distributes Windows Server 2012 on optical media and in an .iso (ISO) image format. ISO
                                                format is becoming more common as organizations acquire software over the Internet rather than by
                                                obtaining physical removable media. Once you have obtained the Windows Server 2012 operating
                                                system from Microsoft, you can use your own method to deploy the operating system. You can install
                                                Windows Server 2012 by using a variety of methods, including the
                                                following:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Optical Media Advantages include: Traditional method of deployment. Disadvantages include:
                                                    Requires that the computer have access to a DVD-ROM drive.
                                                    Is typically slower than USB media.
                                                    You cannot update the installation image without replacing the media.
                                                    You can only perform one installation per DVD-ROM at a time.

                                                    All computers with USB drives allow boot from USB media.

                                                    The answer file can be stored on a USB drive, minimizing the amount of interaction that the
                                                    administrator must perform</li>
                                                <li>Disadvantages include:
                                                    Requires the administrator to perform special steps to prepare USB media from an ISO file.

                                                <li>Advantages include:
                                                    With virtualization software, you can mount the ISO image directly and install Windows Server 2012
                                                    on the virtual machine.

                                                <li> Advantages include:
                                                    It is possible to boot a server off a boot device (DVD or USB drive) and install from
                                                    installation files that are hosted on a network share.</li> 
                                                <li>Disadvantages include: This method is much slower than using Windows Deployment Services. If you already have access to
                                                    a DVD or USB media, it is simpler to use those tools for operating system deployment.

                                                <li>Advantages include:
                                                    You can deploy Windows Server 2012 from .wim image files or specially prepared virtual hard disk
                                                    (.vhd) files.
                                                    You can use the Windows® Automated Installation Kit (AIK) to configure lite-touch
                                                    deployment.
                                                    Deployment Services server, and the operating system image is transmitted to the server over the
                                                    network.
                                                    Windows Deployment Services allows multiple concurrent installations of Windows Server 2012
                                                    using multicast network transmissions.

                                                <li> Advantages include:
                                                    Configuration Manager allows you to fully automate the deployment of Windows Server 2012 to new
                                                    servers that do not have an operating system installed. This process is called Zero Touch deployment.

                                                steps you will need after the installation of the operating system. Microsoft has chosen to
                                                automatically give a computer name consisting of a sequence of letters and numbers that for

                                                <p>Is A collection of computers & servers that are part of the same centralized database. in general,
                                                   a domain is an area of control or a sphere of knowledge.</p>
                                                <p> Windows domains provide network administrators with a way to manage a large number of PCs
                                                    and control them from one place. One or more servers — known as domain controllers — have
                                                    control over the domain and the computers on it.</p>  
                                                <p>Domains are generally made up of computers on the same local network. However, computers
                                                   joined to a domain can continue communicating with their domain controller over VPN or Internet connection. This allows businesses and schools to remotely manage laptops they provide
                                                   to their employees and students.</p>   
                                                <p> In the Internet's domain name system (DNS), a domain is a name with which name server
                                                    records are associated that describe subdomains or host. For example, "tss.com" could be a
                                                    domain with records for "www.tss.com"</p>

                                                <p> Workgroup is Microsoft's term for peer-to-peer local area network. Computers running
                                                    Microsoft operating systems in the same workgroup may share files, printers, or Internet
                                                    connection. Workgroup contrasts with a domain, in which computers rely on centralized
                                                    authentication</p> 
                                                <p> Computers on a network can be part of a workgroup or a domain. The main difference between
                                                    workgroups and domains is how resources on the network are managed. Computers on home
                                                    networks are usually part of a workgroup, and computers on workplace networks are usually part
                                                    of a domain</p>

                                                <p>Each computer has a set of user accounts. To use any computer in the workgroup, you must have
                                                    an account on that computer.</p>   
                                                <p>There are typically no more than ten to twenty computers. </p>

                                                <p> One or more computers are servers. Network administrators use servers to control the security
                                                    and permissions for all computers on the domain. This makes it easy to make changes because
                                                    the changes are automatically made to all computers.</p>

                                                   needing an account on that computer.</p> 
                                                <p>There can be hundreds or thousands of computers. </p>

                                                    name. A child domain and its parent share a two-way transitive trust.</p> 
                                                <p>A domain tree exists when one domain is the child of another domain that we called Domain

                                                <p>You might have several domain trees in your organization that you need to share resources. To
                                                   solve this problem, you can join the trees to form a forest.</p>  
                                                <p> A forest is a collection of trees that don’t necessarily form a contiguous namespace (although

                                                    connection, you can set your operating system to use a network- or Internet-based time server, so
                                                    that it checks and corrects its clock at regular intervals from a known reference</p>

                                                <p> Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft technology used to manage computers and other devices on
                                                    a network. As a network grows, Active Directory provides a way to organize a large number of
                                                    users into logical groups and subgroups, while providing access control at each level </p>

                                                <p>There are several benefits to using AD DS for your basic network user and computer management</p>

                                                    AD DS provides built in replication and redundancy: if one Domain Controller (DC) fails,
                                                    another DC picks up the load
                                                    All access to network resources goes through AD DS, which keeps network access rights

                                                <p> Domain Controllers (DC) are the servers in your network that host AD DS. DCs respond to
                                                    authentication requests and store AD DS data. DCs host other services that are complementary to
                                                    AD DS as well. Those are:
                                                    Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC): The kdc verifies and encrypts kerberos tickets that AD
                                                    DS uses for authentication
                                                    NetLogon: Netlogon is the authentication communication service.
                                                    Windows Time (W32time): Kerberos requires all computer times to be in sync.
                                                    Intersite Messaging (IsmServ): Intersite messaging allows DCs to communicate with each other

                                                    A domain controller (DC) is a server that responds to security authentication requests within a
                                                    Windows Server domain. It is a server on a Microsoft Windows or Windows NT network that is
                                                    responsible for allowing host access to Windows domain resources.</p>

                                                    circular logging, old log files are constantly deleted, once they have been written to the database.
                                                    At any point, you will find the edb.log file, and maybe one or more Edbxxxxx.log files.</p>

                                                    Specifically, we have to configure the server with a static IP address and a DNS suffix. The
                                                    suffix will be used to fully-qualify the server name. To begin:</p>

                                                        an IP address , subnet mask and default gateway IP addresses that are all compatible with

                                                    filling out those fields , click the Advanced button.</p>

                                                    The Forward Lookup Zones node stores zones that are used to map host names to IP addresses,
                                                    whereas the Reverse Lookup Zones node stores zones that are used to map IP addresses to host

                                                <p> A cache-only DNS server contains no zones or resource records. Its only function is to cache
                                                    answers to queries that it processes, that way if the server receives the same query again later,
                                                    rather than go through the recursion process again to answer the query, the cache-only DNS
                                                    server would just return the cached response, thereby saving time. With that said, our newly
                                                    installed DNS server is already a cache-only DNS server!</p> 
                                                <p>Creating a Primary Forward Lookup Zone</p>  
                                                <p> A forward lookup zone is a DNS zone in which hostname to IP address relations are stored.
                                                    When a computer asks the IP address of a specific hostname, the forward lookup zone is
                                                    checked and the desired result is returned. DNS has a few different types of zones, and each has
                                                    a different function. We will first create a primary forward lookup zone titled firewall.test . We do not want to name it firewall.cx , or any variation that uses a valid top-level domain name, as

                                                <p>DNS uses resource records (RRs) to tie host names to IP addresses and the reverse. There are
                                                    different types of resource records, and the DNS server will respond with the record that is
                                                    requested in a query.
                                                    The most common resource records are: Host (A); Mail Exchanger (MX); Alias (CNAME); and
                                                    Service Location (SRV) for Active Directory zones. As such, we will create all but SRV records
                                                    because Active Directory will create those automatically:</p>

                                                <p> In Windows Server 2003 computers there are two types of user accounts. These types are local
                                                    and domain user accounts. The local user accounts are the single user accounts that are locally
                                                    created on a Windows Server 2003 computer to allow a user to log on to a local computer. The
                                                    local user accounts are stored in Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database locally on the hard
                                                    disk. The local user accounts allow you to access local resources on a computer
                                                    On the other hand the domain user accounts are created on domain controllers and are saved in
                                                    Active Directory. These accounts allow to you access resources anywhere on the network. On a
                                                    Windows Server 2003 computer, which is a member of a domain, you need a local user account
                                                    to log in locally on the computer and a domain user account to log in to the domain. Although
                                                    you can have a same login and password for both the accounts, they are still entirely different
                                                    account types.You become a local administrator on your computer automatically because local computer
                                                    account is created when a server is created. A domain administrator can be local administrator on all the member computers of the domain because by default the domain administrators are added
                                                    to the local administrators group of the computers that belong to the domain.
                                                    This article discusses about creating local as well as domain user accounts, creating groups and
                                                    then adding members to groups.</p>

                                                 <span class="title-ph">Creating a Domain User Account</span>
                                                 <p>The process of creating a domain user account is more or less similar to the process of creating a
                                                    local user account. The only difference is a few different options in the same type of screens and
                                                    a few steps more in between.
                                                    For example, you need Active Directory Users and Computers MMC (Microsoft Management
                                                    Console) to create domain account users instead of Local Users and Computers MMC. Also,
                                                    when you create a user in domain then a domain is associated with the user by default. However,
                                                    you can change the domain if you want.
                                                    Besides all this, although, a domain user account can be created in the Users container, it is
                                                    always better to create it in the desired Organization Unit (OU).
                                                    To create a domain user account, follow the steps given below:</p>
                                                <ol>
                                                    <li>Log on as Administrator and open Active Directory Users and Computers MMC from the

                                                    <li>Expand the OU in which you want to create a user, right-click the OU and select New->User from the menu that appears.<img src="img_SFDLT_5/setup_server-52.png" alt=""></li>  
                                                    <li> Alternatively, you can click on Action menu and select New->User from the menu that appears.The New Object –User dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10.</li>  
                                                    <li> Provide the First name, Last name, and Full name in their respective fields.</li>
                                                    <li> Provide a unique logon name in User logon name field and then select a domain from the
                                                        dropdown next to User logon name field if you want to change the domain name.
                                                        <p>The domain and the user name that you have provided will appear in the User logon name (preWindows 2000) fields to ensure that user is allowed to log on to domain computers that are using

                                                        The second screen of New Object –User dialog box appears similar to Figure 4.</li>
                                                    <li> Provide the User name and the Password in their respective fields.</li> 
                                                    <li> Select the desired password settings requirement: <p>Select User must change password at next logon option if you want the user to change the
                                                        password when the user first logs into computer. Select User cannot change password option if
                                                        you do not want the user to change the password. Select Password never expires option if you do
                                                        not want the password to become obsolete after a number of days. Select Account is disabled to
                                                        disable this user account.</p></li>

                                                    <li> Follow the steps 9-13 mentioned in Creating a Local User Account section to associate a user to a group.</li>    
                                                </ol>    
                                                <span class="title-ph">Creating Groups</span>
                                                <p> Just like user accounts, the groups on a Windows Server 2003 computer are also of two types,
                                                    the built-in local groups and built in domain groups. The example of certain built in domain
                                                    groups are: Account Operators, Administrators, Backup Operators, Network Configuration
                                                    Operators, Performance Monitor Users, and Users. Similarly, certain built in local groups are:
                                                    Administrators, Users, Guests, and Backup operators.
                                                    The built-in groups are created automatically when the operating system is installed and become
                                                    a part of a domain. However, sometimes you need to create your own groups to meet your
                                                    business requirements. The custom groups allow you limit the access of resources on a network
                                                    to users as per your business requirements. To create custom groups in domain, you need to:</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>. Log on as Administrator and open Active Directory Users and Computers MMC from the
                                                        Administrative Tools in Control Panel, as shown in Figure 9.</li>
                                                    <li>Right-click the OU and select New->Group from the menu that appears.
                                                        The New Object –Group dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10.</li> 
                                                    <li> Provide the name of the group in the Group name field.
                                                        The group name that you have provided will appear in the Group name (pre-Windows 2000)
                                                        field to ensure that group is functional on domain computers that are using earlier versions of
                                                        Windows such as Windows NT.</li>
                                                    <li> Select the desired group scope of the group from the Group scope options.
                                                        If the Domain Local Scope is selected the members can come from any domain but the members
                                                        can access resources only from the local domain.
                                                        If Global scope is selected then members can come only from local domain but can access
                                                        resources in any domain.If Universal scope is selected then members can come from any domain and members can access
                                                        resources from any domain</li>
                                                    <li> Select the group type from the Group Type options.
                                                        The group type can be Security or Distribution. The Security groups are only used to assign and
                                                        gain permissions to access resources and Distribution groups are used for no-security related
                                                        tasks such as sending emails to all the group members <img src="img_SFDLT_5/setup_server-53.png" alt=""></li> 
                                                    <li> Click OK.
                                                        You can add members to group just as you add groups to members. Just right-click the group in
                                                        Active Directory Users and Computers node in the Active Directory Users and Computers snapin, select Properties, click Members tab from the Properties window of the group and then follow
                                                        the steps from 11-13 from Creating Local User Accounts section.</li>

                                            <p>Let me explain this lease generation process with a funny conversation between Server and

                                                In this first step, Clients that are DHCP enabled and have no IP addresses and are assigned will
                                                broadcast on the network and say</p>

                                                In this second step, if any DCHP Server hears DHCP Discover ( from step 1), it will broadcast
                                                out and says</p>

                                                This is where the client machines accepts the offer (IP address) from DHCP Server and
                                                broadcasts out back to to DHCP Server, which says</p>

                                               DCHP Server sends an acknowledgement to the client with the lease information.</p>

                                                <span class="title-ph">DHCP Scope</span>
                                                <p>A DHCP scope is a collection of IP address settings that are configured for devices such as a
                                                    computer to use. You can create multiple scopes for different device types and subnets. For
                                                    example, I have a scope for computers and different scopes for IP phones.
                                                    When you setup a scope, you will need to configure the following:</p>
                                                <p> <span class="title-ph">Scope name </span> – This is the name of the scope. Give it a descriptive name so it is easy to identify
                                                   which devices it is for.</p>    
                                                <p><span class="title-ph">IP address range </span> – This is the IP range that you want the devices to use. For example 10.2.2.0/24</p>   
                                                <p><span class="title-ph"> IP address exclusions</span> – You can specify to exclude IP address from the scope. This is useful if
                                                    you have devices on the subnet that need a static IP like a router or server.</p>
                                                <p><span class="title-ph">Lease duration </span> – The lease specifies how long a client has an IP address before returning it to the pool.</p>  
                                                <p><span class="title-ph">DHCP options </span>– There are a number of different options you can include when DHCP assigns
                                                   an IP address. More on this below</p> 
                                                <span class="title-ph">DHCP options </span> 
                                                <p>There are many DCHP options, below are the most commonly used options in a Windows domain.</p>  
                                                <p>
                                                    <p> <span class="title-ph">003 router</span> – The default gateway of the subnet</p>
                                                    <p> <span class="title-ph">005 DNS server</span> – The IP address of the DNS server clients should use for name resolution.</p>
                                                    <p> <span class="title-ph">015 DNS Domain Name </span> – The DNS suffix the client should use, often the same as the domain name</p>
                                                </p> 
                                                <span class="title-ph">DHCP filtering</span>
                                                <p>DHCP filtering can be used to deny or allow devices based on their MAC address. For example,
                                                   I use it to block mobile devices from connecting to our secure wifi</p>

                                                <span class="title-ph">Superscopes</span>   
                                                <p>A superscope is a collection of individual DHCP scopes. This can be used when you want to join
                                                   to scopes together. Honestly, I’ve never used this.</p>

                                                <span class="title-ph">Split Scopes</span>  
                                                <p>This is a method of providing fault tolerance for a DHCP scope. Using DHCP failover is not the
                                                   preferred method for fault tolerance.</p>

                                                    <p>DCHP failover was a new feature starting in server version 2012. It allows two DHCP servers to
                                                    share lease information providing high availability for DCHP services. If one server becomes

                                                    <p>There are a few considerations at this point. If a short lease duration is configured, clients will be
                                                        renewing their IP addresses more frequently. The result will be additional network traffic and
                                                        additional strain on the DHCP server. On the other hand if a long lease duration is configured, IP
                                                        addresses previously obtained by decommissioned clients would remain leased and unavailable
                                                        to future clients until the leases either expire or are manually deleted.
                                                        Additionally if network changes occur, such as the implementation of a new DNS server, those
                                                        clients would not receive those updates until their leases expire or the computers are restarted.
                                                        As Microsoft states, “lease durations should typically be equal to the average time the computer
                                                        is connected to the same physical network.” You would typically leave the default lease duration
                                                        in an environment where computers are rarely moved or replaced, such as a wired network. In an

                                                        would want to specify a short duration since a new wireless client could roam within range at

                                                        DHCP database contains the DHCP configuration data (such as information about scopes,

                                                        within the DHCP manager by right-clicking on the DHCP server (see below) or they can be done

                                                        only used if the server detects that its database is corrupt. They cannot be used to manually

                                             <p>CPU Usage</p>
                                             <p>Resource Monitor is a tool built into Windows and Windows Server that provides more detail
                                                about processor usage than Task Manager. ... This tab provides details about processor usage
                                                such as Name, PID, Description, Status, Threads, CPU, and Average CPU. The rows of data can
                                                be sorted in ascending or descending order.
                                                The most basic form of monitoring comes from the Task Manager. The Task Manager has seen
                                                many improvements over the years. In Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, we now have a
                                                very detailed and robust, built-in means of monitoring many performance aspects in real time. As
                                                you can see from the screen shot below, the new Task Manager has a significantly different look
                                                to it. We now list all Applications, Windows Processes, and Background Processes and allow
                                                each item to be expanded out for more detail. In the screen shot below, you can see that we have
                                                expanded out the Internet Explorer process so that it shows each window or tab that is open. This
                                                allows us to see what CPU resources are being utilized be each open windows or tab. This is
                                                very useful for troubleshooting an web page or app that may be frozen or causing a performance
                                                on a machine.</p>

                                            <p>When we select the Performance tab in Task manager, we also have a new view into the big 4
                                                items. For CPU monitoring, the default view consolidates all physical and logical CPU’s into a
                                                single CPU view. in the sample from my machine, the default view shows the cumulative
                                                performance across all CPU’s. Even though it only shows a single CPU in this view, my machine
                                                is actually a quad-processor machine. To change the view to chow all logical CPU’s, right click
                                                in the main window, and select Change graph to –> Logical Processors</p>

                                            <p> Another feature we have in the Task Manager is access to the Resource Monitor. It is the link at
                                                the bottom of the previous screen shot. When you open the Resource Monitor we cab get a detailed real time view of CPU usage across any process. You can check the box to the left of a
                                                process to add/remove it from the graphed processes on the far right hand side.</p>

                                            <p>On Windows 8 client machines, here is also an App History tab where we can find historical
                                                CPU performance of the apps on our systems. This data is reflected for the previous 30 days and
                                                can manually be reset at anytime from this screen. Double-clicking an application in the list will
                                                launch that application.</p>

                                            <p>Finally, we have a Users Tab that allows us to get information about what apps and processes are
                                                consuming resources in different user sessions. Below we see my active session as well as
                                                another user that logged in but is currently disconnected.</p>

                                            <p> Now….if we really want to dig into CPU performance monitoring, we need to leverage
                                                Performance Monitor and the new Hyper-V counters. However, we have to be careful to select
                                                the appropriate counters. When the Hyper-V role is enabled on a Windows Server, there are a
                                                whole host of new PerfMon counters and objects that are added to allow us to monitor
                                                performance of the virtualized workloads. These can be found in PerfMon by selecting to add
                                                counters then scrolling to the “Hyper-V” section where you will see a large number of new
                                                Hyper-V related counters. What you choose to monitor will depend on what information you are
                                                trying to retrieve.</p>

                                            <p>in the first section we run through using the Task Manager to view RAM utilisation on a
                                                Windows Server 2003 VPS. The second section covers Windows Server 2008 and using the

                                                <p>In the bottom section of the window, you will see Physical Memory (K), which displays your
                                                    current RAM usage in kilobytes(KB). One MB is 1024KB. Dividing the values shown in this
                                                    section by 1024(or roughly 1000) will give you the RAM usage in MB. e.g. 523792 KB is
                                                    approximately 511 MB.
                                                    A value of 32768KB (32MB) Available or less would indicate the VPS is close to, or at it's
                                                    physical memory limit.</p>

                                                <p>The lower graph on the left side of the window shows the Page File usage. This value will
                                                    increase along with your RAM usage.
                                                    If your Available Physical Memory value is very low, you may also notice your Page File

                                                <p>High Page File values along with a low Available Physical Memory will often be accompanied
                                                    by a noticeable performance degradation, and in some cases an unresponsive VPS. e.g. you may
                                                    notice a long delay between clicking on the interface, and the interface responding, or possibly
                                                    find you can't log into your VPS' desktop at all.
                                                    If your VPS is performing poorly while showing values similar to those mentioned above, this is
                                                    an indication that your VPS doesn't have enough RAM to meet the current requirements of the
                                                    software you are running.
                                                    You may want to close any programs on your VPS that aren't required and check the
                                                    performance of the VPS again, or consider upgrading the amount of RAM on your VPS.
                                                    RAM upgrades can be done by going to your VPS Management page in mPanel, then clicking
                                                    Change next to the Memory listed. Upgrading RAM requires the VPS to be rebooted.</p>

                                                <p>Network monitoring is a critical IT process where all networking components like routers,
                                                    switches, firewalls, servers, and VMs are monitored for fault and performance and evaluated
                                                    continuously to maintain and optimize their availability. One important aspect of network
                                                    monitoring is that it should be proactive.
                                                    So why is it important to monitor networks? The network is the life line of the IT
                                                    infrastructure. When networks fail, the flow of information required by applications and
                                                    business operations stop.
                                                    Networks are dynamic environments. Network Admins are continually asked to add new users,
                                                    technologies and applications to their networks. These changes can impact their ability to
                                                    deliver consistent, predictable network performance.</p>

                                            <p>The release activity follows from the completed development process, and is sometimes classified as part
                                                of the development process rather than deployment process. It includes all the operations to prepare a
                                                system for assembly and transfer to the computer system(s) on which it will be run in production.</p>
                                            <span class="tit">Installation</span>  
                                            <p> installation involves establishing some form of command, shortcut, script or service for executing the
                                                software (manually or automatically). For complex systems it may involve configuration of the system –
                                                possibly by asking the end-user questions about its intended use, or directly asking them how they would
                                                like it to be configured – and/or making all the required subsystems ready to use.
                                                In larger software deployments on servers, the main copy of the software to be used by users - "production"
                                                - might be installed on a production server in a production environment. Activation
                                                Activation is the activity of starting up the executable component of software for the first time (not to be
                                                confused with the common use of the term activation concerning a software license, which is a function

                                            <p> Deactivation is the inverse of activation, and refers to shutting down any already-executing components
                                                of a system. Deactivation is often required to perform other deployment activities, e.g., a software system
                                                may need to be deactivated before an update can be performed.</p>  
                                            <span class="title-ph">Uninstall</span>   
                                            <p>It is the removal of a system that is no longer required. It may also involve some reconfiguration of other
                                               software systems in order to remove the uninstalled system's dependencies.</p> 
                                            <span class="title-ph">Update</span>  
                                            <p>The update process replaces an earlier version of all or part of a software system with a newer release. It
                                                commonly consists of deactivation followed by installation. On some systems, such as on Linux when
                                                using the system's package manager, the old version of a software application is typically also uninstalled
                                                as an automatic part of the process.</p>
                                            <span class="title-ph">Built-in update</span> 
                                            <p> Mechanisms for installing updates are built into some software systems (or, in the case of some operating
                                                systems such as Linux, Android and iOS, into the operating system itself). Automation of these update
                                                processes ranges from fully automatic to user initiated and controlled.</p>

                                            <p>Version tracking systems help the user find and install updates to software systems. For example: Software
                                                Catalog stores version and other information for each software package installed on a local system. One
                                                click of a button launches a browser window to the upgrade web page for the application, including auto
                                                filling of the user name and password for sites that require a login.</p>

                                                is server virtualization, which uses a software layer called a hypervisor to emulate the underlying

                                            <p> Functional requirement. In software engineering and systems engineering, a functional requirement
                                                defines a function of a system or its component, where a function is described as a specification of
                                                behaviour between outputs and inputs.
                                                Typically, functional requirements will specify a behaviour or function, for example:
                                                “Display the name, total size, available space and format of a flash drive connected to the USB port.”
                                                Other examples are “add customer” and “print invoice”.</p> 
                                            
                                            <span class="title-ph">Non-functional Requirements</span>   
                                            <p>In systems engineering and requirements engineering, a non-functional requirement (NFR) is a
                                               requirement that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours. They are contrasted with functional requirements that define specific behavior or functions.
                                                for example: “Modified data in a database should be updated for all users accessing it within 2 seconds.”
                                                As said above, non-functional requirements specify the system’s ‘quality characteristics’ or ‘quality
                                                attributes’.</p>

                                                <span class="title-ph">Protocols</span>
                                                <p> The Internet relies on a number of protocols in order to function properly. A protocol is simply a standard
                                                    for enabling the connection, communication, and data transfer between two places on a network. Here are
                                                    some of the key protocols that are used for transferring data across the Internet.
                                                    HTTP
                                                    HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the standard protocol for transferring web pages (and
                                                    their content) across the Internet.
                                                    HTTPS
                                                    HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer. Think of it as a secure version
                                                    of HTTP. HTTPS is used primarily on web pages that ask you to provide personal or sensitive information
                                                    (such as a password or your credit card details).
                                                    When you browse a web page using HTTPS, you are using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). For a website
                                                    to use HTTPS it needs to have an SSL certificate installed on the server.
                                                    FTP
                                                    FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It is used to transfer files across the Internet. FTP is commonly used
                                                    by web developers to publish updates to a website (i.e. to upload a new version of the website).</p>

                                                    .htaccess file, meaning that subfolders can inherit the versions their parent directories are using.
                                                    The easiest way to be certain what version of PHP a folder is using is to create a phpinfo.php file in that
                                                    directory and navigate to it. The top of the phpinfo page will tell you what version of PHP is being

                                                outsourced basis to support enterprise operations. Typically, IaaS provides hardware, storage, servers and
                                                data center space or network components; it may also include software.</p> 

                                            <p>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing
                                                resources over the internet. IaaS is one of the three main categories of cloud computing services, alongside
                                                software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).</p>

                                                <p> Code running in the browser is known as client-side code and is primarily concerned with improving the
                                                    appearance and behaviour of a rendered web page. This includes selecting and styling UI components,
                                                    creating layouts, navigation, form validation, etc.
                                                    Client-side code is written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — it is run inside a web browser and has
                                                    little or no access to the underlying operating system (including limited access to the file system). Serverside code</p>

                                                <p>Server-side code can be written in any number of programming languages — examples of popular
                                                    serverside web languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, and NodeJS(JavaScript). The server-side code
                                                    has full access to the server operating system and the developer can choose what programming language
                                                    (and specific version) they wish to use.</p>  
                                                <p>Developers typically write their code using web frameworks. Web frameworks are collections of
                                                    functions, objects, rules and other code constructs designed to solve common problems, speed up
                                                    development, and simplify the different types of tasks faced in a particular domain.</p>

                                            <span class="title-ph">What PHP stands for</span>
                                            <p>PHP is a server side scripting language. that is used to develop Static websites or Dynamic websites or Web
                                                applications. PHP stands for <span class="title-ph">Hypertext Pre-processor</span>, that earlier stood for Personal Home Pages.
                                                PHP scripts can only be interpreted on a server that has PHP installed.
                                                The client computers accessing the PHP scripts require a web browser only.
                                                A PHP file contains PHP tags and ends with the extension ".php". </p>
                                            <span class="title-pg">Purpose of PHP</span>  
                                            <p> PHP is a general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to server-side web development, in
                                                which case PHP generally runs on a web server.
                                                PHP is mainly focused on server-side scripting, so you can do anything any other CGI program can do, such
                                                as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies. But PHP can do much
                                                more. There are three main areas where PHP scripts are used.
                                                One of the important advantages of PHP is that it is Open Source. Therefore, PHP is readily available and is
                                                entirely free. In contrast to other scripting languages used for web development which requires the user to
                                                pay for the support files, PHP is open to everyone, anytime and anywhere. PHP files
                                                File extension and Tags In order for the server to identify our PHP files and scripts, we must save the file
                                                with the “.php” extension. Older PHP file extensions include </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>.phtml </li>
                                                <li>.php3 </li>
                                                <li>.php4 </li>
                                                <li>.php5 </li>
                                                <li>.phps </li>
                                            </ul>      
                                            <p>PHP was designed to work with HTML, and as such, it can be embedded into the HTML code. </p>
                                            <img src="img_SFDLT_5/web_dev-1.png" alt="">
                                            <p> You can create PHP files without any html tags and that is called Pure PHP file .
                                                The server interprets the PHP code and outputs the results as HTML code to the web browsers.
                                                In order for the server to identify the PHP code from the HTML code, we must always enclose the PHP code
                                                in PHP tags. </p>
                                            <p> A PHP tag starts with the less than symbol followed by the question mark and then the words “php”.
                                                PHP is a case sensitive language, “VAR” is not the same as “var”.
                                                The PHP tags themselves are not case-sensitive, but it is strongly recommended that we use lower case letter.
                                                The code below illustrates the above point. </p>

                                                A PHP file normally contains HTML tags, and some PHP scripting code.

                                                    A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language into
                                                    another programming language. The name compiler is primarily used for programs that translate source code
                                                    from a high-level programming language to a lower level language to create an executable program.
                                                    The PHP language is interpreted. The binary that lets you interpret PHP is compiled, but what you write is
                                                    interpreted. Both. PHP is compiled down to an intermediate bytecode that is then interpreted by the runtime

                                                <p> Note: Since PHP 5.4+ you can also specify integers in binary (base 2) notation. To use binary notation precede
                                                    the number with 0b (e.g. $var = 0b11111111;).
                                                    PHP Strings </p>
                                                <p> Strings are sequences of characters, where every character is the same as a byte.
                                                    A string can hold letters, numbers, and special characters and it can be as large as up to 2GB (2147483647
                                                    bytes maximum). The simplest way to specify a string is to enclose it in single quotes (e.g. 'Hello world!'),
                                                    however you can also use double quotes ("Hello world!").

                                                    An array is a variable that can hold more than one value at a time. It is useful to aggregate a series of related
                                                    items together, for example a set of country or city names.
                                                    An array is formally defined as an indexed collection of data values. Each index (also known as the key) of
                                                    an array is unique and references a corresponding value.

                                                <p> PHP Objects
                                                    An object is a data type that not only allows storing data but also information on, how to process that data.
                                                    An object is a specific instance of a class which serve as templates for objects. Objects are created based on
                                                    this template via the new keyword.
                                                    Every object has properties and methods corresponding to those of its parent class. Every object instance is
                                                    completely independent, with its own properties and methods, and can thus be manipulated independently of
                                                    other objects of the same class.
                                                    Here's a simple example of a class definition followed by the object creation.
                                                    Example </p> 
                                                <p>
                                                    <span class="close_tag"><</span>?php  <br>
                                                        // Class definition class greeting{ // properties <br>
                                                        public $str = "Hello World!"; <br>

                                                        // methods function show_greeting(){ return $this->str; <br>
                                                        } <br>
                                                    } <br>
                                                    // Create object from class $message = new greeting; var_dump($message); ?<span class="close_tag">></span>
                                                </p>
                                                <p> <span class="close_tag">Tip:</span> The data elements stored within an object are referred to as its properties and the information, or code
                                                    which describing how to process the data is called the methods of the object.
                                                    PHP NULL
                                                    The special NULL value is used to represent empty variables in PHP. A variable of type NULL is a variable
                                                    without any data. NULL is the only possible value of type null.
                                                    Example </p>  
                                                <p><span class="close_tag"><</span>?php $a = NULL; var_dump($a); echo "<span class="close_tag"><</span>br<span class="close_tag">></span>"; $b = "Hello World!"; $b = NULL; var_dump($b); ?> </p>         
                                                <p> When a variable is created without a value in PHP like $var; it is automatically assigned a value of null.
                                                    Many novice PHP developers mistakenly considered both $var1 = NULL; and $var2 = ""; are same, but this is not
                                                    true. Both variables are different — the $var1 has null value while $var2 indicates no value assigned to it.
                                                    PHP Resources
                                                    A resource is a special variable, holding a reference to an external resource.
                                                    Resource variables typically hold special handlers to opened files and database connections.

                                                    In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable:
                                                    Example </p>
                                                <p>
                                                <span class="close_tag"><</span>?php
                                                        $txt = "Hello world!";
                                                        $x = 5;
                                                        $y = 10.5;
                                                    ?> 
                                                </p>  
                                                <p>
                                                    After the execution of the statements above, the variable $txt will hold the value Hello world!, the variable
                                                    $x will hold the value 5, and the variable $y will hold the value 10.5.
                                                    Note: When you assign a text value to a variable, put quotes around the value.
                                                    Note: Unlike other programming languages, PHP has no command for declaring a variable. It is created the
                                                    moment you first assign a value to it.
                                                    A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

                                                    PHP is a Loosely Typed Language
                                                    In the example above, notice that we did not have to tell PHP which data type the variable is.
                                                    PHP automatically converts the variable to the correct data type, depending on its value.
                                                    PHP Variables Scope
                                                    In PHP, variables can be declared anywhere in the script.
                                                    The scope of a variable is the part of the script where the variable can be referenced/used.
                                                    PHP has three different variable scopes: 
                                                </p> 
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>local</li>
                                                    <li>global </li>
                                                    <li>static</li>
                                                </ul> 
                                                <p>Global and Local Scope
                                                    A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function:
                                                    Example</p>
                                                <p>
                                                <span class="close_tag"><<span>?php <br>
                                                        $x = 5; // global scope

                                                        function myTest() {
                                                        // using x inside this function will generate an error echo "<span class="close_tag"><</span>p <span class="close_tag">></span>Variable x inside function is: $x <span class="title-ph"><</span>/p <span class="title-ph">></span>";
                                                        }
                                                        myTest();

                                                        echo "<span class="close_tag"><</span>p>Variable x outside function is: $x <span class="close_tag"><</span>/p <span class="close_tag">></span>"; 
                                                    ?>
                                                </p>   
                                                <p>A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function: Example</p> 
                                                <p>
                                                <span class="close_tag"><</span>?php 
                                                        function myTest() {
                                                                $x = 5; // local scope
                                                                echo "<span class="close_tag"><</span>p<span class="close_tag">></span>Variable x inside function is: $x<span class="close_tag"><</span>/p<span class="close_tag">></span>";
                                                        }
                                                        myTest();

                                                        // using x outside the function will generate an error echo "<span class="close_tag"><</span>p<span class="close_tag">></span>Variable x outside function is: $x<span class="title-ph"><</span>/p<span class="title-ph">></span>"; 
                                                    ?>
                                                </p>  
                                                <p> You can have local variables with the same name in different functions, because local variables are only
                                                    recognized by the function in which they are declared.
                                                    PHP The global Keyword
                                                    The global keyword is used to access a global variable from within a function.
                                                    To do this, use the global keyword before the variables (inside the function):
                                                    Example</p>
                                                <p>
                                                <span class="close_tag"><</span>?php
                                                        $x = 5;
                                                        $y = 10;

                                                        function myTest() {
                                                        global $x, $y;
                                                        $y = $x + $y;
                                                        }

                                                        myTest();
                                                        echo $y; // outputs 15 
                                                    ?> 
                                                </p> 
                                                <p>
                                                    PHP also stores all global variables in an array called $GLOBALS[index]. The index holds the name of the
                                                    variable. This array is also accessible from within functions and can be used to update global variables
                                                    directly.
                                                    The example above can be rewritten like this:
                                                    Example 
                                                </p>   
                                                <p>
                                                <span class="close_tag"><</span>?php
                                                        $x = 5;
                                                        $y = 10;

                                                        function myTest() {
                                                        $GLOBALS['y'] = $GLOBALS['x'] + $GLOBALS['y'];
                                                        }

                                                        myTest();
                                                        echo $y; // outputs 15 
                                                    ?> 
                                                </p>

                                                    PHP The static Keyword
                                                    Normally, when a function is completed/executed, all of its variables are deleted. However, sometimes we
                                                    want a local variable NOT to be deleted. We need it for a further job.
                                                    To do this, use the static keyword when you first declare the variable:
                                                    Example
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                <span class="close_tag"><</span>?php 
                                                        function myTest() { static $x = 0; echo $x;
                                                            $x++;
                                                        }

                                                        myTest();
                                                        myTest(); myTest();

                                                    Arrays in PHP is a type of data structure that allows us to store multiple elements of similar data type under
                                                    a single variable thereby saving us the effort of creating a different variable for every data. The arrays are
                                                    helpful to create a list of elements of similar types, which can be accessed using their index or key. Suppose
                                                    we want to store five names and print them accordingly. This can be easily done by the use of five different
                                                    string variables. But if instead of five, the number rises to hundred, then it would be really difficult for the
                                                    user or developer to create so much different variables. Here array comes into play and helps us to store every
                                                    element within a single variable and also allows easy access using an index or a key.
                                                    An array is created using an array() function in PHP.
                                                    There are basically three types of arrays in PHP: 
                                                </p>

                                            <p>Very often when you write code, you want tmo perform different actions for different conditions. You can
                                                use conditional statements in your code to do this.
                                                In PHP we have the following conditional statements:</p>

                                                    value of the expression is then compared with the values for each case in the structure. If there is a match, the
                                                    block of code associated with that case is executed. Use break to prevent the code from running into the next
                                                    case automatically. The default statement is used if no match is found. $favcolor = "red"; 
                                                </p><p>
                                                    switch ($favcolor) { case "red": echo "Your favorite color is red!"; break; case "blue": echo
                                                    "Your favorite color is blue!"; break; case "green": echo "Your favorite color is
                                                    green!"; break; default: echo "Your favorite color is neither red, blue, nor

                                                <p> Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again in a row. Instead of
                                                    adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops to perform a task like this.

                                                        application should not have multiple functions doing the same thing.
                                                        PHP has a lot! of built in functions and while you are not expected to learn all of them at once there are some
                                                        useful functions that can help in everyday programming and we will start from there.
                                                        String Manipulation Functions
                                                        Some of the most useful PHP functions are string manipulation functions. As the name suggests they
                                                        manipulate strings.
                                                        Finding the length of a String
                                                        The strlen() functions works by passing a string or variable and then returns the total number of characters
                                                        including spaces. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        <span class="close_tag"><</span>?php
                                                            $name = "Matthew "; echo strlen($name); // 8 
                                                        ?>
                                                    </p>  
                                                    <p>
                                                        Return part of a String
                                                        The substr() function is used to return a substring or part of a string. This function has 3 parameters which you
                                                        can pass along.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>substr($string, $start,$length); </p>

                                                        <li>$string – a string of text or a variable containing a string of text. Input must be at least one character. </li>
                                                        <li>$start – think of the string as an array starting from [0]. If you wanted to start from the first character you
                                                           would enter 0. A negative value will go to the end of the string. </li>
                                                        <li>$length – (Optional) is the number of characters returned after the start character. If this value is less than
                                                            or equal to the start value then it will return false. </li>

                                                        Note: If you don’t provide a $length parameter, this function will just return the remainder of the string
                                                        starting from the $start parameter.
                                                        Converting strings to UPPER or lower case
                                                        Two useful string functions that are simple to use are strtoupper() and strtolower(), these functions can convert your
                                                        strings to all UPPERCASE or all lowercase.
                                                        They are very useful for case sensitive operations where you may require all characters to be lowercase for
                                                        example.

                                                        Sometimes we need to find a substring within a string and to do that we can use strpos()
                                                    </p>

                                                        we can almost make use of an if statement and some variables to make the strpos function more useful and

                                                        Arithmetic Manipulation Functions As well as string manipulation function, PHP also has functions to manipulate numbers.
                                                        Rounding numbers
                                                        One of the most commonly used math function is round(). This function rounds numbers with decimal points
                                                        up or down. You can round a number to an integer (whole number) or to a floating point (decimal numbers).

                                                        <li>$val – is the value to be rounded. </li>
                                                        <li>$precision – (optional) number of decimal places to round to. </li>

                                                        Other math functions for rounding are ceil() and floor() . If you simply need to round a number to the nearest
                                                        whole number then these functions are better suited to that purpose.

                                                        Generating Random Numbers
                                                        Another very common math function is rand() which returns a random number between two numbers.</p>

                                                        Array or array() is itself a function that stores multiple values in to a single variable. Aside from the array()
                                                        function there are a number of other functions to manipulate arrays, here we will look at some of the most
                                                        common ones.
                                                        Adding New Elements
                                                        Adding new elements to the end of an array can be achieved by calling the array_push() function. 
                                                    </p>

                                                        <li>$array – the array in which you are adding new elements to. </li>
                                                        <li>$value1 – (required) is the first value to push onto the end of the $array. </li>

                                                            $array = array_push($games, "Fallout 4");

                                                        ?>
                                                        However is better to list each element in a single call like this:
                                                        <span class="close_tag"><</span>?php

                                                            $array = array_push($games,
                                                            "Farcry 4",
                                                            "Fallout 4",
                                                            "Metal Gear",
                                                            "Witcher 3");

                                                            echo $array; // returns 4 var_dump($games); 
                                                        ?>
                                                        Both methods result in the same outcome. If you echo or  print array_push() it will return the number of items to be
                                                        pushed in to the array.
                                                        If you var_dump() the target array you will see something like this.

                                                        Information can be passed to functions through arguments. An argument is just like a variable.
                                                        Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as
                                                        you want, just separate them with a comma.
                                                        The following example has a function with one argument ($fname). When the familyName() function is
                                                        called, we also pass along a name (e.g. Jani), and the name is used inside the function, which outputs several

                                                <p>A cookie is often used to identify a user. A cookie is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer.
                                                    Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser, it will send the cookie too. With PHP, you can
                                                    both create and retrieve cookie values. </p>

                                                <p>Programming a PHP/Java Bridge servlet
                                                    You need to use Servlet API to create servlets. There are two packages that you must remember while using
                                                    API, the javax.servlet package that contains the classes to support generic servlet (protocolindependent
                                                    servlet) and the javax.servlet.http package that contains classes to support http servlet.
                                                    This shows how to create a servlet and how to call it from PHP code.

                                                    <p> A session is a way to store information (in variables) to be used across multiple pages.
                                                        When you work with an application, you open it, do some changes, and then you close it. This is much like a
                                                        Session. The computer knows who you are. It knows when you start the application and when you end. But
                                                        on the internet there is one problem: the web server does not know who you are or what you do, because
                                                        the HTTP address doesn't maintain state.
                                                        Session variables solve this problem by storing user information to be used across multiple pages (e.g.
                                                        username, favorite color, etc). By default, session variables last until the user closes the browser.
                                                        So; Session variables hold information about one single user, and are available to all pages in one application. </p>
                                                    <span class="title-ph">Session life time</span> 
                                                    <p>
                                                        The session will last for 1440 seconds (24 minutes). You're searching for gc_maxlifetime Create sessions
                                                        A session is started with the session_start() function.
                                                        Session variables are set with the PHP global variable: $_SESSION.
                                                        Now, let's create a new page called "demo_session1.php". In this page, we start a new PHP session and set
                                                        some session variables:

                                                    When you embed PHP code in an HTML file, you need to use the .php file extension for that file, so that

                                                    Moreover POST supports advanced functionality such as support for multi-part binary input while uploading
                                                    files to server.
                                                    However, because the variables are not displayed in the URL, it is not possible to bookmark the page.
                                                    $_POST is an array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method. </p>

                                                    displayed in the URL). GET also has limits on the amount of information to send. The limitation is about
                                                    2000 characters. However, because the variables are displayed in the URL, it is possible to bookmark the
                                                    page. This can be useful in some cases.

                                                    GET may be used for sending non-sensitive data. </p>

                                                <p>REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and is an architectural style for network communication
                                                    between applications, which relies on a stateless protocol (usually HTTP) for interaction.
                                                    HTTP Verbs Represent Actions
                                                    In RESTful APIs, we use the HTTP verbs as actions, and the endpoints are the resources acted upon.
                                                    We’ll be using the HTTP verbs for their semantic meaning: </p>
