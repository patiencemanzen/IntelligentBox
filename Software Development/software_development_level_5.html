                                                    The techniques in trigonometry are used for finding
                                                    relevance in navigation particularly satellite systems and
                                                    astronomy, naval and aviation industries, oceanography,
                                                    land surveying, and in cartography (creation of maps).
                                                    Now those are the scientific applications of the concepts
                                                    in trigonometry, but most of the mathematics we study
                                                    would seem (on the surface) to have little real-life
                                                    application. Trigonometry is really relevant in our day to
                                                    day activities.

                                                Solving a triangle is to find the length of its sides and
                                                measures of its angles. There are two methods for solving
                                                a triangle: cosine law and sine law

                                                In addition, the most easily accessed geothermal resources, 
                                                natural hot springs and geysers, will not last for more than 
                                                a few decades if exploited for energy on a large scale. 
                                                Estimates vary widely as to how long fossil fuels, oil, coal, 
                                                and natural gas will last. These estimates depend on assumptions 
                                                about how much fossil fuel remains in the ground, how fast it will 
                                                be used, and how much money and effort will be spent to recover it. 
                                                However, most estimates agree that, if present rates of consumption 
                                                continue, proven oil and natural gas reserves will run out in this 
                                                century, while coal reserves will last more than 200 years. 
                                                Once they are used, these energy sources cannot be replaced.

                                            <p>
                                                <span class="title-ph">Gravity</span> is the mysterious force that
                                                 makes everything fall down towards the Earth. But after research 
                                                 it has turned out that all objects have gravity. It’s just that some objects, 
                                                 like the Earth and the Sun, have a stronger gravity than others. How much 
                                                 gravity an object has depends its mass. It also depends on how close you are 
                                                 to the object. The closer you are, the stronger the gravity.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Gravity is very important to our everyday lives. 
                                                Without Earth’s gravity we would fly right off it. 
                                                If you kicked a ball, it would fly off forever. 
                                                While it might be fun to try for a few minutes, 
                                                we certainly can’t live without gravity. Gravity also is 
                                                important on a larger scale. It is the Sun’s gravity that 
                                                keeps the Earth in orbit around the Sun. Life on Earth needs 
                                                the Sun’s light and warmth to survive. Gravity helps the Earth 
                                                to stay at just the right distance from the Sun, so it’s not too 
                                                hot or too cold.

                                                    message from one end to other. We can express our feelings 
                                                    to others by speaking, writing or silent indications.

                                                    In telecommunication, a communication system is a collection of individual 
                                                    communication networks, transmission systems, relay stations tributary stations 
                                                    and Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) usually capable of interconnection and interoperation 
                                                    to form an integrated whole.In the transmission section, 
                                                    first of all, the source generated information is fed to the input transducer, 
                                                    which converts energy of one form to another form, usually in electrical form. 
                                                    This electrical signal or base band signal is sent to the transmitter.

                                                       efficient transmission. It modulates the information signal with a high frequency carrier. 
                                                       After processing the signal transmitter transmits the signal, through channel to the receiver. <br>

                                                       attenuate the signal and distorts its waveform. The signal attenuation increases with the length 
                                                       of the channel. There are different types of channels for different communication systems, such as 
                                                       wire, coaxial cable, wave-guide, optical fiber or radio link through which transmitter output is sent. <br>

                                                       transducer, which converts the electrical signal to its original form. By this way, the signal reached to

                                                    Modulation is a technique used for encoding information into a RF channel. 
                                                    Typically the process of modulation combines an information signal with a 
                                                    carrier signal to create a new composite signal that can be transmitted over
                                                    a wireless link. In theory, a message signal can be directly sent into space to a 
                                                    receiver by simply powering an antenna with the message signal. However, message 
                                                    signals typically don’t have a high enough bandwidth to make efficient direct 
                                                    propagation. In order to efficiently transmit data, the lower frequency data 
                                                    must be modulated onto a higher frequency wave.

                                                    The high frequency wave acts as a carrier that transmits the data through space

                                                    Frequency modulation is widely used for FM radio broadcasting. 
                                                    It is also used in telemetry, radar, seismic prospecting monitoring

                                                    video-transmission systems. In radio transmission, an advantage of 
                                                    frequency modulation is that it has a larger signal-to-noise ratio 
                                                    and therefore rejects radio frequency interference better than an 
                                                    equal power amplitude modulation (AM) signal. For this reason,

                                                    before the information is transmitted, it is first mixed to a carrier signal 
                                                    so that it can be transmitted over a long distance with low attenuation.

                                                    received on the earth surface is slightly below 1400 w/m2.

                                                    This radiation is assumed to be incident on a plane perpendicular to the earth's surface. 
                                                    It is assumed that the earth is at its mean distance from the sun.

                                                            restricts privileges to minimum-required operations and data. Most native database security platforms offer some of

                                                            By enforcing policies for time of day, location, and application client and volume of data retrieved,

                                                            All backups should be encrypted. In fact, some vendors have suggested that future DBMS products 
                                                            may not support the creation of unencrypted backups. Encryption of online production database

                                               <p>There are two classes of resources in any computer system: (active) subjects and (passive) objects. The ways a subject access 
                                                   an object are called access privileges. Access privileges allow subjects to either manipulate objects (read, write, execute, etc.) 
                                                   or modify the access control information (transfer ownership, grant and revoke privileges, etc.). The access control may be based 
                                                   on different policies which in turn follows different principles. The choice of a security policy is important because it influences
                                                    the flexibility, usability, and performance of the system. The principles on which policies are based are as follows:  </p>

                                                    <p>The principle addresses the issue who is responsible for the maintenance and management of privileges in the access control model. 
                                                        In centralized administration, a single authority controls all security aspects of the system, while in decentralized system different 
                                                        authorities control different portions of the database. Access control is enforced by a reference monitor which mediates every attempted 
                                                        access by a user to objects in the system. The reference monitor consults an authorization database in order to determine if the user 
                                                        attempting to do an operation is actually authorized to perform that operation. Authorizations in this database are administered 
                                                        and maintained by a security administrator as shown in fig 1. The administrator sets these authorizations on the basis of the 
                                                        security policy. Access control is different from authentication. Authentication is a process of signing on to a computer system by 
                                                        providing an identifier and a password. So, correctly establishing the identity of the user is the responsibility of the authentication 
                                                        service. On the other hand, access control assumes that authentication of the user has been successfully verified prior to enforcement 
                                                        of access control via a reference monitor.</p>

                                                <p>In computer science, an Access Control Matrix or Access Matrix is an abstract, formal security model of protection state in computer 
                                                    systems that characterize the rights of each subject with respect to every object in the system. It was first introduced by
                                                    <span class="title-ph"> Butler W. Lampson in 1971.</span></p>
                                                <p>An access matrix can be envisioned as a rectangular array of cells, with one row per subject and one column per object. The entry in a cell –

                                                    Each column is equivalent to an access control list for the object; and each row is equivalent to an access profile for the subject</p>
                                                <p>According to the model, the protection state of a computer system can be abstracted as a set of objects O , that is the set of entities 
                                                    that needs to be protected (e.g. processes, files, memory pages) and a set of subjects S , that consists of all active entities 
                                                    (e.g. users, processes). Further there exists a set of rights R  of the form r(s,o), where r include in R , s include in S and o 
                                                    include in O . A right thereby specifies the kind of access a subject is allowed to process object.</p>

                                                    It is a facility for the user, simplifying and customizing the external model through which the user deals with the database, 
                                                    freeing the user from the complexities of the underlying model.                    
                                                </p>
                                                <p>It is also a security device, hiding structures and data that the user should not see.in the relational and object-relational models, 
                                                    a user’s external model can consist entirely of views. By specifying restrictions in the WHERE line of the SELECT statement used to 
                                                    create views, the view can be made value-dependent. Figure 8.2(A) gives an example of a view created from the Student table by including 
                                                    only data about students whose major is CSC.</p>

Knowing about the existence of the log can be a deterrent in itself. If the DBA suspects that data is being compromised without triggering security log entries, it is possible to set up an audit trail .

                                                <p>Symmetric key encryption is a form of encryption where the decryption key is the same as the encryption key, and the decrypting algorithm is the inverse of the encrypting algorithm. </p>
                                                <p>Every user in this system needs to have a pair of dissimilar keys,<span class="title-ph">private key and public key.</span> These keys are mathematically related – when one key is used for encryption, the other can decrypt the ciphertext back to the original plaintext.</p>
                                                <p>One widely used symmetric key encryption scheme was the Data Encryption Standard (DES) , devised by IBM for the U.S. National Bureau of Standards and adopted in 1977. In the DES scheme, the algorithm itself is public, while the key is private. FIGURE 8.4 gives an overview of 
                                                    the DES process.  the DES algorithm uses a 56-bit key on 64-bit blocks of plaintext, producing 64-bit blocks of ciphertext. When data is encoded, it is split up into 64-bit blocks. Within each block, characters are substituted and rearranged according to the value of the key.  
                                                    the decoding algorithm uses the same key to put back the original characters and to restore them to their original positions in each block. </p>

                                                <p>Two major challenges with the DES system involve key security and the ease of cracking the code.  e key must be kept secure or the encryption is worthless, since anyone with the key has access to the data.  erefore, the security depends on the secrecy of the key, but all 
                                                    authorized users must be told the key.  e more people who know the key, the more likely it is that the key will be disclosed to unauthorized users.</p>

                                                    Often, more secure lines are used for key distribution, or the key is distributed by mail or messenger

Public-key encryption uses two separate keys, where one key is a public key and the other key is a private ke y. FIGURE 8.5 provides an overview of public-key encryption. 
                                                    For each user, a pair of large prime numbers, ( p , q ), is chosen as the user’s private key , and the product of the pair, p*q , becomes the user’s public key . Public keys are shared freely, so that anyone wishing to send a message to a user can  nd his or her public key easily. </p>

                                                <p>The SSADM method involves the application of a sequence of analysis, documentation and design tasks concerned with the following.</p>
                                                <div class="mt-2">
                                                    <span class="title-ph">Stage 1 – Feasibility study</span>
                                                    <p>In order to determine whether or not a given project is feasible, there must be some form of investigation 
                                                        into the goals and implications of the project. For very small scale projects this may not be necessary 
                                                        at all as the scope of the project is easily understood. In larger projects, the feasibility may be done 
                                                        but in an informal sense, either because there is no time for a formal study or because the project is a 
                                                        “must-have” and will have to be done one way or the other. A data flow Diagram is used to describe how the 
                                                        current system works and to visualize the known problems.</p>
                                                    <p>When a feasibility study is carried out, there are four main areas of consideration:</p>  
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Technical – is the project technically possible?</li>
                                                        <li>Financial – can the business afford to carry out the project?</li>
                                                        <li>Organizational – will the new system be compatible with existing practices?</li>
                                                        <li>Ethical – is the impact of the new system socially acceptable?</li>
                                                    </ul>  
                                                    <p>To answer these questions, the feasibility study is effectively a condensed version of a comprehensive systems analysis and design. 
                                                        The requirements and usages are analyzed to some extent, some business options are drawn up and even some details of the technical 
                                                        implementation. The product of this stage is a formal feasibility study document. SSADM specifies the sections that the study should 
                                                        contain including any preliminary models that have been constructed and also details of rejected options and the reasons for their

                                                    <p>The developers of SSADM understood that in almost all cases there is some form of current system even if it is entirely composed of people and paper. 
                                                        Through a combination of interviewing employees, circulating questionnaires, observations and existing documentation, the analyst comes to full understanding 
                                                        of the system as it is at the start of the project. This serves many purposes (Like examples?).</p>

                                                    <p>Having investigated the current system, the analyst must decide on the overall design of the new system. To do this, he or she, using the outputs of the previous stage, 
                                                        develops a set of business system options. These are different ways in which the new system could be produced varying from doing nothing to throwing out the old system 
                                                        entirely and building an entirely new one. The analyst may hold a brainstorming session so that as many and various ideas as possible are generated.</p>
                                                        <p>The ideas are then collected to options which are presented to the user. The options consider the following:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>the degree of automation</li>
                                                        <li>the boundary between the system and the users</li>
                                                        <li>the distribution of the system, for example, is it centralized to one office or spread out across several?</li>
                                                        <li>cost/benefit</li>
                                                        <li>impact of the new system</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>Where necessary, the option will be documented with a logical data structure and a level 1 data-flow diagram.</p>   
                                                    <p>The users and analyst together choose a single business option. This may be one of the ones already defined or 
                                                        may be a synthesis of different aspects of the existing options. The output of this stage is the single selected 
                                                        business option together with all the outputs of the feasibility stage.</p>

                                                    <p>This is probably the most complex stage in SSADM. Using the requirements developed in stage 1 and working within 
                                                        the framework of the selected business option, the analyst must develop a full logical specification of what the 
                                                        new system must do. The specification must be free from error, ambiguity and inconsistency. 
                                                        By logical, we mean that the specification does not say how the system will be implemented but 
                                                        rather describes what the system will do.</p>
                                                    <p>To produce the logical specification, the analyst builds the required logical models for both the data-flow diagrams 
                                                        (DFDs) and the Logical Data Model (LDM), consisting of the Logical Data Structure (referred to in other methods as 
                                                        entity relationship diagrams) and full descriptions of the data and its relationships. 
                                                        These are used to produce function definitions of every function which the users will 
                                                        require of the system, Entity Life-Histories (ELHs) which describe all events through the life of an entity, 
                                                        and Effect Correspondence Diagrams (ECDs) which describe how each event interacts with all relevant entities. 
                                                        These are continually matched against the requirements and where necessary, the requirements are added to and completed.</p>

                                                    <p>Though the previous level specifies details of the implementation, the outputs of this stage are implementation-independent and concentrate on the requirements
                                                        for the human computer interface. The logical design specifies the main methods of interaction in terms of menu structures and command structures.</p>
                                                    <p>One area of activity is the definition of the user dialogues. These are the main interfaces with which the users will interact with the system. Other activities 
                                                        are concerned with analyzing both the effects of events in updating the system and the need to make inquiries about the data on the system. Both of these use the events, 
                                                        function descriptions and effect correspondence diagrams produced in stage 3 to determine precisely how to update and read data in a consistent and secure way.</p>
                                                    <p>The logical design of a system pertains to an abstract representation of the data flows, inputs and outputs of the system. This is often conducted via modelling, 
                                                        using an over-abstract (and sometimes graphical) model of the actual system. In the context of systems, designs are included. Logical design includes

                                                    <p>The physical design relates to the actual input and output processes of the system. 
                                                        This is explained in terms of how data is input into a system, how it is verified/authenticated, 
                                                        how it is processed, and how it is displayed. In physical design, the following requirements about 
                                                        the system are decided.</p>

                                                    <p>Put another way, the physical portion of system design can generally be broken down into three subtasks:</p>  
                                                    <ol type="1">
                                                        <li>User Interface Design</li>
                                                        <li>Data Design</li>
                                                        <li>Process Design</li>
                                                    </ol>
                                                    <p>User Interface Design is concerned with how users add information to the system and with how the system 
                                                        presents information back to them. Data Design is concerned with how the data is represented and stored 
                                                        within the system. Finally, Process Design is concerned with how data moves through the system, 
                                                        and with how and where it is validated, secured and/or transformed as it flows into, through and out 
                                                        of the system. At the end of the system design phase, documentation describing the three sub-tasks is 
                                                        produced and made available for use in the next phase.</p>
                                                    <p>Physical design, in this context, does not refer to the tangible physical design of an information system. 
                                                        To use an analogy, a personal computer's physical design involves input via a keyboard, processing within 
                                                        the CPU, and output via a monitor, printer, etc. It would not concern the actual layout of the tangible 
                                                        hardware, which for a PC would be a monitor, CPU, motherboard, hard drive, modems, video/graphics cards, 
                                                        USB slots, etc. It involves a detailed design of a user and a product database structure processor and a 
                                                        control processor. The H/S personal specification is developed for the proposed system.</p>
                                                    <p>This is the final stage where all the logical specifications of the system are converted to descriptions 
                                                        of the system in terms of real hardware and software. This is a very technical stage and a simple overview 
                                                        is presented here.</p>   
                                                    <p>The logical data structure is converted into a physical architecture in terms of database structures. 
                                                        The exact structure of the functions and how they are implemented is specified. The physical data structure 
                                                        is optimized where necessary to meet size and performance requirements.</p>

                                                modules that combines both data and process. The main aim of Object Oriented Design (OOD) is to improve the quality and 
                                                productivity of system analysis and design by making it more usable.</p>
                                            <p>In analysis phase, OO models are used to fill the gap between problem and solution. It performs well in situation where systems 
                                                are undergoing continuous design, adaption, and maintenance. It identifies the objects in problem domain, classifying them in

                                                    <p>Encapsulation is a process of information hiding. It is simply the combination of process and data into a single entity. Data of an object is hidden from the rest of the system and available only through the services of the class. 
                                                        It allows improvement or modification of methods used by objects without affecting other parts of a system.</p>
